<HTML><BODY>Another translation of the Poetic Edda of Saemund. This translation is much more extensive than the work by Bray I've run through the rounds recently (and this time, it is without the original text). The book also includes a large number of footnotes, linked not to a footnote marker, but to the verse number. Please treat those as footnotes during the F-rounds (but no need to insert a marker in the text).

<p>The verse is represented with a wide space in the middle (the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Caesura">Caesura</a>). Please use a standing bar | to represent that during proofreading.

</p><p>A few old-Icelandic/old-Norse letters appear. Most are covered by the standard guidelines. For the o with hook below (ǫ), please use [o,] (although the hook is not a cedilla), o with hook and macron: [=o,], o with diaeresis and macron [=ö], æ with macron [=æ].

</p><p>For the accent marks not on top of a letter (mostly seen in the index), please use ´ and ´´ (available from the character menu's: tip: use copy-paste on pages where it appears a lot.)
