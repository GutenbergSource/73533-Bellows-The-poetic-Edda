<pb id="pb.ix" n="ix" facs="f:011"/></p></div1><div1 id="ack" type="Acknowledgement"><head>ACKNOWLEDGEMENT</head><p>The General Introduction mentions many of the scholars to whose work this translation owes a special debt. Particular reference, however, should here be made to the late William Henry Schofield, Professor of Comparative Literature in Harvard University and President of The American-Scandinavian Foundation, under whose guidance this translation was begun; to Henry Goddard Leach, for many years Secretary of The American-Scandinavian Foundation, and to William Witherle Lawrence, Professor of English in Columbia University and Chairman of the Foundation&#8217;s Committee on Publications, for their assistance with the manuscript and the proofs; and to Hanna Astrup Larsen, the Foundation&#8217;s literary secretary, for her efficient management of the complex details of publication.



<pb id="pb.xi" n="xi" facs="f:013"/></p></div1><div1 id="intro" type="Introduction"><head>GENERAL INTRODUCTION</head><p>There is scarcely any literary work of great importance which has been less readily available for the general reader, or even for the serious student of literature, than the <hi>Poetic Edda</hi>. Translations have been far from numerous, and only in Germany has the complete work of translation been done in the full light of recent scholarship. In English the only versions were long the conspicuously inadequate one made by Thorpe, and published about half a century ago, and the unsatisfactory prose translations in Vigfusson and Powell&#8217;s <hi>Corpus Poeticum Boreale</hi>, reprinted in the Norr&#339;na collection. An excellent translation of the poems dealing with the gods, in verse and with critical and explanatory notes, made by Olive Bray, was, however, published by the Viking Club of London in 1908. In French there exist only partial translations, chief among them being those made by Bergmann many years ago. Among the seven or eight German versions, those by the Brothers Grimm and by Karl Simrock, which had considerable historical importance because of their influence on nineteenth century German literature and art, and particularly on the work of Richard Wagner, have been largely superseded by Hugo Gering&#8217;s admirable translation, published in 1892, and by the recent two-volume rendering by Genzmer, with excellent notes by Andreas Heusler, 1914&#8211;1920. There are competent translations in both Norwegian and Swedish. The lack of any complete and adequately annotated English rendering in metrical form, based on a critical text, and profiting by the cumulative labors of such scholars as Mogk, Vigfusson, <pb id="pb.xii" n="xii" facs="f:014"/>Finnur Jonsson, Grundtvig, Bugge, Gislason, Hildebrand, L&#252;ning, Sweet, Niedner, Ettm&#252;ller, M&#252;llenhoff, Edzardi, B. M. Olsen, Sievers, Sijmons, Detter, Heinzel, Falk, Neckel, Heusler, and Gering, has kept this extraordinary work practically out of the reach of those who have had neither time nor inclination to master the intricacies of the original Old Norse.
</p><p>On the importance of the material contained in the <hi>Poetic Edda</hi> it is here needless to dwell at any length. We have inherited the Germanic traditions in our very speech, and the <hi>Poetic Edda</hi> is the original storehouse of Germanic mythology. It is, indeed, in many ways the greatest literary monument preserved to us out of the antiquity of the kindred races which we call Germanic. Moreover, it has a literary value altogether apart from its historical significance. The mythological poems include, in the <hi>Voluspo</hi>, one of the vastest conceptions of the creation and ultimate destruction of the world ever crystallized in literary form; in parts of the <hi>Hovamol</hi>, a collection of wise counsels that can bear comparison with most of the Biblical Book of Proverbs; in the <hi>Lokasenna</hi>, a comedy none the less full of vivid characterization because its humor is often broad; and in the <hi>Thrymskvitha</hi>, one of the finest ballads in the world. The hero poems give us, in its oldest and most vivid extant form, the story of Sigurth, Brynhild, and Atli, the Norse parallel to the German <hi>Nibelungenlied</hi>. The <hi>Poetic Edda</hi> is not only of great interest to the student of antiquity; it is a collection including some of the most remarkable poems which have been preserved to us from the period before the pen and the printing-press replaced the poet-singer and oral tradition. It is above all else the desire <pb id="pb.xiii" n="xiii" facs="f:015"/>to make better known the dramatic force, the vivid and often tremendous imagery, and the superb conceptions embodied in these poems which has called forth the present translation.


</p><div2 type="Section"><head>WHAT IS THE POETIC EDDA?</head><p>Even if the poems of the so-called <hi>Edda</hi> were not so significant and intrinsically so valuable, the long series of scholarly struggles which have been going on over them for the better part of three centuries would in itself give them a peculiar interest. Their history is strangely mysterious. We do not know who composed them, or when or where they were composed; we are by no means sure who collected them or when he did so; finally, we are not absolutely certain as to what an &#8220;Edda&#8221; is, and the best guess at the meaning of the word renders its application to this collection of poems more or less misleading.
</p><p>A brief review of the chief facts in the history of the <hi>Poetic Edda</hi> will explain why this uncertainty has persisted. Preserved in various manuscripts of the thirteenth and early fourteenth centuries is a prose work consisting of a very extensive collection of mythological stories, an explanation of the important figures and tropes of Norse poetic diction,&#8212;the poetry of the Icelandic and Norwegian skalds was appallingly complex in this respect,&#8212;and a treatise on metrics. This work, clearly a handbook for poets, was commonly known as the &#8220;Edda&#8221; of Snorri Sturluson, for at the head of the copy of it in the <hi>Uppsalabok</hi>, a manuscript written presumably some fifty or sixty years after Snorri&#8217;s death, which was in 1241, we find: &#8220;This book is called Edda, which Snorri Sturluson composed.&#8221; This work, well known as the <hi>Prose Edda</hi>, Snorri&#8217;s <hi>Edda</hi> or the <pb id="pb.xiv" n="xiv" facs="f:016"/><hi>Younger Edda</hi>, has recently been made available to readers of English in the admirable translation by Arthur G. Brodeur, published by the American-Scandinavian Foundation in 1916.
</p><p>Icelandic tradition, however, persisted in ascribing either this <hi>Edda</hi> or one resembling it to Snorri&#8217;s much earlier compatriot, S&#230;mund the Wise (1056&#8211;1133). When, early in the seventeenth century, the learned Arngrimur Jonsson proved to everyone&#8217;s satisfaction that Snorri and nobody else must have been responsible for the work in question, the next thing to determine was what, if anything, S&#230;mund had done of the same kind. The nature of Snorri&#8217;s book gave a clue. In the mythological stories related a number of poems were quoted, and as these and other poems were to all appearances Snorri&#8217;s chief sources of information, it was assumed that S&#230;mund must have written or compiled a verse <hi>Edda</hi>&#8212;whatever an &#8220;Edda&#8221; might be&#8212;on which Snorri&#8217;s work was largely based.
</p><p>So matters stood when, in 1643, Brynjolfur Sveinsson, Bishop of Skalholt, discovered a manuscript, clearly written as early as 1300, containing twenty-nine poems, complete or fragmentary, and some of them with the very lines and stanzas used by Snorri. Great was the joy of the scholars, for here, of course, must be at least a part of the long-sought <hi>Edda</hi> of S&#230;mund the Wise. Thus the good bishop promptly labeled his find, and as S&#230;mund&#8217;s <hi>Edda</hi>, the <hi>Elder Edda</hi> or the <hi>Poetic Edda</hi> it has been known to this day.
</p><p>This precious manuscript, now in the Royal Library in Copenhagen, and known as the <hi lang="la" xml:lang="la">Codex Regius</hi> (R2365), has been the basis for all published editions of the Eddic poems. A few poems of similar character found elsewhere <pb id="pb.xv" n="xv" facs="f:017"/>have subsequently been added to the collection, until now most editions include, as in this translation, a total of thirty-four. A shorter manuscript now in the Arnamagn&#230;an collection in Copenhagen (AM748), contains fragmentary or complete versions of six of the poems in the <hi lang="la" xml:lang="la">Codex Regius</hi>, and one other, <hi>Baldrs Draumar</hi>, not found in that collection. Four other poems (<hi>Rigsthula</hi>, <hi>Hyndluljoth</hi>, <hi>Grougaldr</hi> and <hi>Fjolsvinnsmol</hi>, the last two here combined under the title of <hi>Svipdagsmol</hi>), from various manuscripts, so closely resemble in subject-matter and style the poems in the <hi lang="la" xml:lang="la">Codex Regius</hi> that they have been included by most editors in the collection. Finally, Snorri&#8217;s <hi>Edda</hi> contains one complete poem, the <hi>Grottasongr</hi>, which many editors have added to the poetic collection; it is, however, not included in this translation, as an admirable English version of it is available in Mr. Brodeur&#8217;s rendering of Snorri&#8217;s work.
</p><p>From all this it is evident that the <hi>Poetic Edda</hi>, as we now know it, is no definite and plainly limited work, but rather a more or less haphazard collection of separate poems, dealing either with Norse mythology or with hero-cycles unrelated to the traditional history of greater Scandinavia or Iceland. How many other similar poems, now lost, may have existed in such collections as were current in Iceland in the later twelfth and thirteenth centuries we cannot know, though it is evident that some poems of this type are missing. We can say only that thirty-four poems have been preserved, twenty-nine of them in a single manuscript collection, which differ considerably in subject-matter and style from all the rest of extant Old Norse poetry, and these we group together as the <hi>Poetic Edda</hi>.
<pb id="pb.xvi" n="xvi" facs="f:018"/></p><p>But what does the word &#8220;Edda&#8221; mean? Various guesses have been made. An early assumption was that the word somehow meant &#8220;Poetics,&#8221; which fitted Snorri&#8217;s treatise to a nicety, but which, in addition to the lack of philological evidence to support this interpretation, could by no stretch of scholarly subtlety be made appropriate to the collection of poems. Jacob Grimm ingeniously identified the word with the word &#8220;edda&#8221; used in one of the poems, the <hi>Rigsthula</hi>, where, rather conjecturally, it means &#8220;great-grandmother.&#8221; The word exists in this sense nowhere else in Norse literature, and Grimm&#8217;s suggestion of &#8220;Tales of a Grandmother,&#8221; though at one time it found wide acceptance, was grotesquely inappropriate to either the prose or the verse work.
</p><p>At last Eirikr Magnusson hit on what appears the likeliest solution of the puzzle: that &#8220;Edda&#8221; is simply the genitive form of the proper name &#8220;Oddi.&#8221; Oddi was a settlement in the southwest of Iceland, certainly the home of Snorri Sturluson for many years, and, traditionally at least, also the home of S&#230;mund the Wise. That Snorri&#8217;s work should have been called &#8220;The Book of Oddi&#8221; is altogether reasonable, for such a method of naming books was common&#8212;witness the &#8220;Book of the Flat Island&#8221; and other early manuscripts. That S&#230;mund may also have written or compiled another &#8220;Oddi-Book&#8221; is perfectly possible, and that tradition should have said he did so is entirely natural.
</p><p>It is, however, an open question whether or not S&#230;mund had anything to do with making the collection, or any part of it, now known as the <hi>Poetic Edda</hi>, for of course the seventeenth-century assignment of the work to him is negligible. <pb id="pb.xvii" n="xvii" facs="f:019"/>We can say only that he may have made some such compilation, for he was a diligent student of Icelandic tradition and history, and was famed throughout the North for his learning. But otherwise no trace of his works survives, and as he was educated in Paris, it is probable that he wrote rather in Latin than in the vernacular.
</p><p>All that is reasonably certain is that by the middle or last of the twelfth century there existed in Iceland one or more written collections of Old Norse mythological and heroic poems, that the <hi lang="la" xml:lang="la">Codex Regius</hi>, a copy made a hundred years or so later, represents at least a considerable part of one of these, and that the collection of thirty-four poems which we now know as the <hi>Poetic</hi> or <hi>Elder Edda</hi> is practically all that has come down to us of Old Norse poetry of this type. Anything more is largely guesswork, and both the name of the compiler and the meaning of the title &#8220;Edda&#8221; are conjectural.


</p></div2><div2 type="Section"><head>THE ORIGIN OF THE EDDIC POEMS</head><p>There is even less agreement about the birthplace, authorship and date of the Eddic poems themselves than about the nature of the existing collection. Clearly the poems were the work of many different men, living in different periods; clearly, too, most of them existed in oral tradition for generations before they were first committed to writing. In general the mythological poems are strongly heathen in character, and as Christianity became generally accepted throughout Norway and Iceland early in the eleventh century, it is altogether likely that most of the poems dealing with the Norse gods antedate the year 1000. On the other hand, Hoffory, Finnur Jonsson and others have shown pretty conclusively from linguistic evidence that <pb id="pb.xviii" n="xviii" facs="f:020"/>these poems cannot have assumed anything like their present form before the ninth century. As for the poems belonging to the hero cycles, one or two of them appear to be as late as 1100, but most of them clearly belong to the hundred years following 950. It is a fairly safe guess that the years between 900 and 1050 saw the majority of the Eddic poems put into shape, but it must be remembered that many changes took place during the long subsequent period of oral transmission, and also that many of the legends, both mythological and heroic, on which the poems were based, certainly existed in Norway, and quite possibly in verse form, long before the year 900. In considering such poems it is essential to forget the present mode of composition, whereby a poet at once fixes his thought and his style by means of writing, and to remember that for at least two centuries, and possibly much longer, the correct transmission of many of the Eddic poems depended solely on accurate hearing and retentive memory.
</p><p>As to the origin of the legends on which the poems are based, the whole question, at least so far as the stories of the gods are concerned, is much too complex for discussion here. How much of the actual narrative material of the mythological lays is properly to be called Scandinavian is a matter for students of comparative mythology to guess at. The tales underlying the heroic lays are clearly of foreign origin: the Helgi story comes from Denmark, and that of V&#246;lund from Germany, as also the great mass of traditions centering around Sigurth (Siegfried), Brynhild, the sons of Gjuki, Atli (Attila), and Jormunrek (Ermanarich). The introductory notes to the various poems deal with the more important of these questions of origin.
<pb id="pb.xix" n="xix" facs="f:021"/></p><p>Of the men who composed these poems,&#8212;&#8220;wrote&#8221; is obviously the wrong word,&#8212;we know absolutely nothing, save that some of them must have been literary artists with a high degree of conscious skill. The Eddic poems are &#8220;folk-poetry,&#8221;&#8212;whatever that may be,&#8212;only in the sense that some of them strongly reflect racial feelings and beliefs; they are anything but crude or primitive in workmanship, and they show that not only the poets themselves, but also many of their hearers, must have made a careful study of the art of poetry.
</p><p>Where the poems were composed is almost equally uncertain. The claims of Norway have been extensively advanced, but the great literary activity of Iceland after the settlement of the island by Norwegian emigrants late in the ninth century makes the theory of an Icelandic source for most of the poems plausible. The two Atli lays, with what authority we do not know, bear in the <hi lang="la" xml:lang="la">Codex Regius</hi> the superscription &#8220;the Greenland poem,&#8221; and internal evidence indicates that this statement is correct. Certainly in one poem, the <hi>Rigsthula</hi>, and probably in several others, there are marks of Celtic influence. During a considerable part of the ninth and tenth centuries, Scandinavians were active in Ireland and in most of the western islands inhabited by branches of the Celtic race. Some scholars claim nearly all the Eddic poems for these &#8220;Western Isles,&#8221; in sharp distinction from Iceland; their arguments are commented on in the introductory note to the <hi>Rigsthula</hi>. However, as Iceland early came to be the true center of this Scandinavian island world, it may be said that most of the evidence concerning the birthplace of the Eddic poems in anything like their present form points in that direction, <pb id="pb.xx" n="xx" facs="f:022"/>and certainly it was in Iceland that they were chiefly preserved.


</p></div2><div2 type="Section"><head>THE EDDA AND OLD NORSE LITERATURE</head><p>Within the proper limits of an introduction it would be impossible to give any adequate summary of the history and literature with which the Eddic poems are indissolubly connected, but a mere mention of a few of the salient facts may be of some service to those who are unfamiliar with the subject. Old Norse literature covers approximately the period between 850 and 1300. During the first part of that period occurred the great wanderings of the Scandinavian peoples, and particularly the Norwegians. A convenient date to remember is that of the sea-fight of Hafrsfjord, 872, when Harald the Fair-Haired broke the power of the independent Norwegian nobles, and made himself overlord of nearly all the country. Many of the defeated nobles fled overseas, where inviting refuges had been found for them by earlier wanderers and plunder-seeking raiders. This was the time of the inroads of the dreaded Northmen in France, and in 885 Hrolf Gangr (Rollo) laid siege to Paris itself. Many Norwegians went to Ireland, where their compatriots had already built Dublin, and where they remained in control of most of the island till Brian Boru shattered their power at the battle of Clontarf in 1014.
</p><p>Of all the migrations, however, the most important were those to Iceland. Here grew up an active civilization, fostered by absolute independence and by remoteness from the wars which wracked Norway, yet kept from degenerating into provincialism by the roving life of the people, which brought them constantly in contact with the culture <pb id="pb.xxi" n="xxi" facs="f:023"/>of the South. Christianity, introduced throughout the Norse world about the year 1000, brought with it the stability of learning, and the Icelanders became not only the makers but also the students and recorders of history.
</p><p>The years between 875 and 1100 were the great spontaneous period of oral literature. Most of the military and political leaders were also poets, and they composed a mass of lyric poetry concerning the authorship of which we know a good deal, and much of which has been preserved. Narrative prose also flourished, for the Icelander had a passion for story-telling and story-hearing. After 1100 came the day of the writers. These sagamen collected the material that for generations had passed from mouth to mouth, and gave it permanent form in writing. The greatest bulk of what we now have of Old Norse literature,&#8212;and the published part of it makes a formidable library,&#8212;originated thus in the earlier period before the introduction of writing, and was put into final shape by the scholars, most of them Icelanders, of the hundred years following 1150.
</p><p>After 1250 came a rapid and tragic decline. Iceland lost its independence, becoming a Norwegian province. Later Norway too fell under alien rule, a Swede ascending the Norwegian throne in 1320. Pestilence and famine laid waste the whole North; volcanic disturbances worked havoc in Iceland. Literature did not quite die, but it fell upon evil days; for the vigorous native narratives and heroic poems of the older period were substituted translations of French romances. The poets wrote mostly doggerel; the prose writers were devoid of national or racial inspiration.
</p><p>The mass of literature thus collected and written down <pb id="pb.xxii" n="xxii" facs="f:024"/>largely between 1150 and 1250 may be roughly divided into four groups. The greatest in volume is made up of the sagas: narratives mainly in prose, ranging all the way from authentic history of the Norwegian kings and the early Icelandic settlements to fairy-tales. Embodied in the sagas is found the material composing the second group: the skaldic poetry, a vast collection of songs of praise, triumph, love, lamentation, and so on, almost uniformly characterized by an appalling complexity of figurative language. There is no absolute line to be drawn between the poetry of the skalds and the poems of the <hi>Edda</hi>, which we may call the third group; but in addition to the remarkable artificiality of style which marks the skaldic poetry, and which is seldom found in the poems of the <hi>Edda</hi>, the skalds dealt almost exclusively with their own emotions, whereas the Eddic poems are quite impersonal. Finally, there is the fourth group, made up of didactic works, religious and legal treatises, and so on, studies which originated chiefly in the later period of learned activity.


</p></div2><div2 type="Section"><head>PRESERVATION OF THE EDDIC POEMS</head><p>Most of the poems of the <hi>Poetic Edda</hi> have unquestionably reached us in rather bad shape. During the long period of oral transmission they suffered all sorts of interpolations, omissions and changes, and some of them, as they now stand, are a bewildering hodge-podge of little-related fragments. To some extent the diligent twelfth century compiler to whom we owe the <hi lang="la" xml:lang="la">Codex Regius</hi>&#8212;S&#230;mund or another&#8212;was himself doubtless responsible for the patchwork process, often supplemented by narrative prose notes of his own; but in the days before written records existed, it was easy to lose stanzas and longer passages <pb id="pb.xxiii" n="xxiii" facs="f:025"/>from their context, and equally easy to interpolate them where they did not by any means belong. Some few of the poems, however, appear to be virtually complete and unified as we now have them.
</p><p>Under such circumstances it is clear that the establishment of a satisfactory text is a matter of the utmost difficulty. As the basis for this translation I have used the text prepared by Karl Hildebrand (1876) and revised by Hugo Gering (1904). Textual emendation has, however, been so extensive in every edition of the <hi>Edda</hi>, and has depended so much on the theories of the editor, that I have also made extensive use of many other editions, notably those by Finnur Jonsson, Neckel, Sijmons, and Detter and Heinzel, together with numerous commentaries. The condition of the text in both the principal codices is such that no great reliance can be placed on the accuracy of the copyists, and frequently two editions will differ fundamentally as to their readings of a given passage or even of an entire poem. For this reason, and because guesswork necessarily plays so large a part in any edition or translation of the Eddic poems, I have risked overloading the pages with textual notes in order to show, as nearly as possible, the exact state of the original together with all the more significant emendations. I have done this particularly in the case of transpositions, many of which appear absolutely necessary, and in the indication of passages which appear to be interpolations.


</p></div2><div2 type="Section"><head>THE VERSE-FORMS OF THE EDDIC POEMS</head><p>The many problems connected with the verse-forms found in the Eddic poems have been analyzed in great detail by Sievers, Neckel, and others. The three verse-forms <pb id="pb.xxiv" n="xxiv" facs="f:026"/>exemplified in the poems need only a brief comment here, however, in order to make clear the method used in this translation. All of these forms group the lines normally in four-line stanzas. In the so-called Fornyrthislag (&#8220;Old Verse&#8221;), for convenience sometimes referred to in the notes as four-four measure, these lines have all the same structure, each line being sharply divided by a c&#230;sural pause into two half-lines, and each half-line having two accented syllables and two (sometimes three) unaccented ones. The two half-lines forming a complete line are bound together by the alliteration, or more properly initial-rhyme, of three (or two) of the accented syllables. The following is an example of the Fornyrthislag stanza, the accented syllables being in italics:
</p><lg lang="non" xml:lang="non" type="Verse"><l><hi>Vrei&#254;r</hi> vas <hi>Ving</hi>&#254;&#243;rr, &#160;&#160;|&#160;&#160; es <hi>vakna</hi>&#254;i
    </l><l>ok <hi>s&#237;ns</hi> <hi>ham</hi>ars &#160;&#160;|&#160;&#160; of <hi>sakna</hi>&#254;i;

    </l><l>r&#233;&#254; <hi>Jar&#254;</hi>ar <hi>burr</hi> &#160;&#160;|&#160;&#160; <hi>umb</hi> at <hi>&#254;reif</hi>ask.</l></lg><p>In the second form, the Ljothahattr (&#8220;Song Measure&#8221;), the first and third line of each stanza are as just described, but the second and fourth are shorter, have no c&#230;sural pause, have three accented syllables, and regularly two initial-rhymed accented syllables, for which reason I have occasionally referred to Ljothahattr as four-three measure. The following is an example:
</p><lg lang="non" xml:lang="non" type="Verse"><l><hi>Ar</hi> skal <hi>r&#237;s</hi>a &#160;&#160;|&#160;&#160; s&#225;s <hi>an</hi>nars <hi>vill</hi>
            </l><l rend="indent(3)"><hi>f&#233;</hi> e&#254;a <hi>fj&#491;r</hi> <hi>haf</hi>a;

            </l><l rend="indent(3)">n&#233; <hi>sof</hi>andi <hi>ma&#254;r sigr</hi>.</l></lg><p>In the third and least commonly used form, the Malahattr (&#8220;Speech Measure&#8221;), a younger verse-form than <pb id="pb.xxv" n="xxv" facs="f:027"/>either of the other two, each line of the four-line stanza is divided into two half-lines by a c&#230;sural pause, each half-line having two accented syllables and three (sometimes four) unaccented ones; the initial rhyme is as in the Fornyrthislag. The following is an example:
</p><lg lang="non" xml:lang="non" type="Verse"><l><hi>Horsk</hi> vas <hi>h&#250;s</hi>freyja, &#160;&#160;|&#160;&#160; <hi>hug</hi>&#254;i at <hi>mann</hi>viti,

    </l><l>skyldu of <hi>s&#225;e</hi> <hi>sig</hi>la, &#160;&#160;|&#160;&#160; en <hi>sj&#491;lf</hi> n&#233; <hi>kvamsk</hi>at.</l></lg><p>A poem in Fornyrthislag is normally entitled <hi>-kvitha</hi> (<hi>Thrymskvitha</hi>, <hi>Guthrunarkvitha</hi>, etc.), which for convenience I have rendered as &#8220;lay,&#8221; while a poem in Ljothahattr is entitled <hi>-mol</hi> (<hi>Grimnismol</hi>, <hi>Skirnismol</hi>, etc.), which I have rendered as &#8220;ballad.&#8221; It is difficult to find any distinction other than metrical between the two terms, although it is clear that one originally existed.
</p><p>Variations frequently appear in all three kinds of verse, and these I have attempted to indicate through the rhythm of the translation. In order to preserve so far as possible the effect of the Eddic verse, I have adhered, in making the English version, to certain of the fundamental rules governing the Norse line and stanza formations. The number of lines to each stanza conforms to what seems the best guess as to the original, and I have consistently retained the number of accented syllables. In translating from a highly inflected language into one depending largely on the use of subsidiary words, it has, however, been necessary to employ considerable freedom as to the number of unaccented syllables in a line. The initial-rhyme is generally confined to two accented syllables in each line. As in the original, all initial vowels are allowed to rhyme interchangeably, <pb id="pb.xxvi" n="xxvi" facs="f:028"/>but I have disregarded the rule which lets certain groups of consonants rhyme only with themselves (<hi>e.g.</hi>, I have allowed initial <hi>s</hi> or <hi>st</hi> to rhyme with <hi>sk</hi> or <hi>sl</hi>). In general, I have sought to preserve the effect of the original form whenever possible without an undue sacrifice of accuracy. For purposes of comparison, the translations of the three stanzas just given are here included:
</p><p>Fornyrthislag:

The nominative ending -r it has seemed best to omit after consonants, although it has been retained after vowels; in Baldr the <pb id="pb.xxvii" n="xxvii" facs="f:029"/>final -r is a part of the stem and is of course retained. I have rendered the Norse &#254; by &#8220;th&#8221; throughout, instead of spasmodically by &#8220;d,&#8221; as in many texts: <hi>e.g.</hi>, Othin instead of Odin. For the Norse &#248; I have used its equivalent, &#8220;&#246;,&#8221; <hi>e.g.</hi>, V&#246;lund; for the &#491; I have used &#8220;o&#8221; and not &#8220;a,&#8221; <hi>e.g.</hi>, Voluspo, not Valuspa or Voluspa. To avoid confusion with accents the long vowel marks of the Icelandic are consistently omitted, as likewise in modern Icelandic proper names. The index at the end of the book indicates the pronunciation in each case.


</p></div2><div2 type="Section"><head>CONCLUSION</head><p>That this translation may be of some value to those who can read the poems of the <hi>Edda</hi> in the original language I earnestly hope. Still more do I wish that it may lead a few who hitherto have given little thought to the Old Norse language and literature to master the tongue for themselves. But far above either of these I place the hope that this English version may give to some, who have known little of the ancient traditions of what is after all their own race, a clearer insight into the glories of that extraordinary past, and that I may through this medium be able to bring to others a small part of the delight which I myself have found in the poems of the <hi>Poetic Edda</hi>.

Another version of it is found in a huge miscellaneous compilation of about the year 1300, the <hi>Hauksbok</hi>, and many stanzas are included in the <hi>Prose Edda</hi> of Snorri Sturluson. The order of the stanzas in the <hi>Hauksbok</hi> version differs materially from that in the <hi lang="la" xml:lang="la">Codex Regius</hi>, and in the published editions many experiments have been attempted in further rearrangements. On the whole, however, and allowing for certain interpolations, the order of the stanzas in the <hi lang="la" xml:lang="la">Codex Regius</hi> seems more logical than any of the wholesale &#8220;improvements&#8221; which have been undertaken.
</p><p>The general plan of the <hi>Voluspo</hi> is fairly clear. Othin, chief of the gods, always conscious of impending disaster and eager for knowledge, calls on a certain &#8220;Volva,&#8221; or wise-woman, presumably bidding her rise from the grave. She first tells him of the past, of the creation of the world, the beginning of years, the origin of the dwarfs (at this point there is a clearly interpolated catalogue of dwarfs&#8217; names, stanzas 10&#8211;16), of the first man and woman, of the world-ash Yggdrasil, and of the first war, between the gods and the Vanir, or, in Anglicized form, the Wanes. Then, in stanzas 27&#8211;29, as a further proof of her wisdom, she discloses some of Othin&#8217;s own secrets and the details of his search for knowledge. Rewarded by Othin for what she has thus far told (stanza 30), she then turns to the real prophesy, the disclosure of the final destruction of the gods. This final battle, in which fire and flood overwhelm heaven and earth as the gods fight with their enemies, is the great fact in Norse mythology; the phrase describing it, <hi>ragna r&#246;k</hi>, &#8220;the fate of the gods,&#8221; has become familiar, by confusion with the word <hi>r&#246;kkr</hi>, &#8220;twilight,&#8221; in the German <hi lang="de" xml:lang="de">G&#246;tterd&#228;mmerung</hi>. The wise-woman tells of the Valkyries who bring the slain warriors to support Othin and the other gods in the battle, of the slaying of Baldr, best and fairest of the gods, through the wiles of Loki, of the enemies of the gods, of the summons to battle on both sides, and of the mighty struggle, till Othin is slain, and &#8220;fire leaps high <pb id="pb2" n="2" facs="f:034"/>about heaven itself&#8221; (stanzas 31&#8211;58). But this is not all. A new and beautiful world is to rise on the ruins of the old; Baldr comes back, and &#8220;fields unsowed bear ripened fruit&#8221; (stanzas 59&#8211;66).
</p><p>This final passage, in particular, has caused wide differences of opinion as to the date and character of the poem. That the poet was heathen and not Christian seems almost beyond dispute; there is an intensity and vividness in almost every stanza which no archaizing Christian could possibly have achieved. On the other hand, the evidences of Christian influence are sufficiently striking to outweigh the arguments of Finnur Jonsson, M&#252;llenhoff and others who maintain that the <hi>Voluspo</hi> is purely a product of heathendom. The roving Norsemen of the tenth century, very few of whom had as yet accepted Christianity, were nevertheless in close contact with Celtic races which had already been converted, and in many ways the Celtic influence was strongly felt. It seems likely, then, that the <hi>Voluspo</hi> was the work of a poet living chiefly in Iceland, though possibly in the &#8220;Western Isles,&#8221; in the middle of the tenth century, a vigorous believer in the old gods, and yet with an imagination active enough to be touched by the vague tales of a different religion emanating from his neighbor Celts.
</p><p>How much the poem was altered during the two hundred years between its composition and its first being committed to writing is largely a matter of guesswork, but, allowing for such an obvious interpolation as the catalogue of dwarfs, and for occasional lesser errors, it seems quite needless to assume such great changes as many editors do. The poem was certainly not composed to tell a story with which its early hearers were quite familiar; the lack of continuity which baffles modern readers presumably did not trouble them in the least. It is, in effect, a series of gigantic pictures, put into words with a directness and sureness which bespeak the poet of genius. It is only after the reader, with the help of the many notes, has familiarized himself with the names and incidents involved that he can begin to understand the effect which this magnificent poem must have produced on those who not only understood but believed it.</p></div2><div2 type="Section"><pb id="pb3" n="3" facs="f:035"/><lg id="lg1.1.1" type="Verse"><l><ab type="verseNum"><ref target="n1.1.1">1</ref>.</ab> Hearing I ask &#160;&#160;|&#160;&#160; from the holy races,

In stanza 1 the Volva, or wise-woman, called upon by Othin, answers him and demands a hearing. Evidently she belongs to the race of the giants (cf. stanza 2), and thus speaks to Othin unwillingly, being compelled to do so by his magic power. <hi>Holy</hi>: omitted in <hi>Regius</hi>; the phrase &#8220;holy races&#8221; probably means little more than mankind in general. <hi>Heimdall</hi>: the watchman of the gods; cf. stanza 46 and note. Why mankind should be referred to as Heimdall&#8217;s sons is uncertain, and the phrase has caused much perplexity. Heimdall seems to have had various attributes, and in the <hi>Rigsthula</hi>, wherein a certain Rig appears as the ancestor of the three great classes of men, a fourteenth century annotator identifies Rig with Heimdall, on what authority we do not know, for the Rig of the poem seems much more like Othin (cf. <hi>Rigsthula</hi>, introductory prose and note). <hi>Valfather</hi> (&#8220;Father of the Slain&#8221;): Othin, chief of the gods, so called because the slain warriors were brought to him at Valhall (&#8220;Hall of the Slain&#8221;) by the Valkyries (&#8220;Choosers of the Slain&#8221;).
</p><p id="n1.1.2"><ab type="parNum"><ref target="lg1.1.2">2</ref>.</ab> <hi>Nine worlds</hi>: the worlds of the gods (Asgarth), of the Wanes (Vanaheim, cf. stanza 21 and note), of the elves (Alfheim), of men (Mithgarth), of the giants (Jotunheim), of fire (Muspellsheim, cf. stanza 47 and note), of the dark elves (Svartalfaheim), of the dead (Niflheim), and presumably of the dwarfs (perhaps Nithavellir, cf. stanza 37 and note, but the ninth world is uncertain). <hi>The tree</hi>: the world-ash Yggdrasil, <pb id="pb4a" n="4" facs="f:036"/>symbolizing the universe; cf. <hi>Grimnismol</hi>, 29&#8211;35 and notes, wherein Yggdrasil is described at length.
</p><p id="n1.1.3"><ab type="parNum"><ref target="lg1.1.3">3</ref>.</ab> <hi>Ymir</hi>: the giant out of whose body the gods made the world; cf. <hi>Vafthruthnismol</hi>, 21. In this stanza as quoted in Snorri&#8217;s <hi>Edda</hi> the first line runs: &#8220;Of old was the age &#160;&#160;|&#160;&#160; ere aught there was.&#8221; <hi>Yawning gap</hi>: this phrase, &#8220;Ginnunga-gap,&#8221; is sometimes used as a proper name.
</p><p id="n1.1.4"><ab type="parNum"><ref target="lg1.1.4">4</ref>.</ab> <hi>Bur&#8217;s sons</hi>: Othin, Vili, and Ve. Of Bur we know only that his wife was Bestla, daughter of Bolthorn; cf. <hi>Hovamol</hi>, 141. Vili and Ve are mentioned by name in the Eddic poems only in <hi>Lokasenna</hi>, 26. <hi>Mithgarth</hi> (&#8220;Middle Dwelling&#8221;): the world of men. <hi>Leeks</hi>: the leek was often used as the symbol of fine growth (cf. <hi>Guthrunarkvitha</hi> I, 17), and it was also supposed to have magic power (cf. <hi>Sigrdrifumol</hi>, 7).
</p><p id="n1.1.5"><ab type="parNum"><ref target="lg1.1.5">5</ref>.</ab> Various editors have regarded this stanza as interpolated; Hoffory thinks it describes the northern summer night in which the sun does not set. Lines 3&#8211;5 are quoted by Snorri. In the manuscripts line 4 follows line 5. Regarding the sun and moon <pb id="pb5a" n="5" facs="f:037"/>as daughter and son of Mundilferi, cf. <hi>Vafthruthnismol</hi>, 23 and note, and <hi>Grimnismol</hi>, 37 and note.
</p><p id="n1.1.6"><ab type="parNum"><ref target="lg1.1.6">6</ref>.</ab> Possibly an interpolation, but there seems no strong reason for assuming this. Lines 1&#8211;2 are identical with lines 1&#8211;2 of stanza 9, and line 2 may have been inserted here from that later stanza.
</p><p id="n1.1.7"><ab type="parNum"><ref target="lg1.1.7">7</ref>.</ab> <hi>Ithavoll</hi> (&#8220;Field of Deeds&#8221;?): mentioned only here and in stanza 60 as the meeting-place of the gods; it appears in no other connection.
</p><p id="n1.1.8"><ab type="parNum"><ref target="lg1.1.8">8</ref>.</ab> <hi>Tables</hi>: the exact nature of this game, and whether it more closely resembled chess or checkers, has been made the subject of a 400-page treatise, Willard Fiske&#8217;s &#8220;Chess in Iceland.&#8221; <hi>Giant-maids</hi>: perhaps the three great Norns, corresponding to the three fates; cf. stanza 20 and note. Possibly, however, something has been lost after this stanza, and the missing passage, replaced by the catalogue of the dwarfs (stanzas 9&#8211;16), may have explained the &#8220;giant-maids&#8221; otherwise than as Norns. In <hi>Vafthruthnismol</hi>, 49, the Norns (this time &#8220;three throngs&#8221; instead of simply &#8220;three&#8221;) are spoken of as giant-maidens; <pb id="pb6a" n="6" facs="f:038"/><hi>Fafnismol</hi>, 13, indicates the existence of many lesser Norns, belonging to various races. <hi>Jotunheim</hi>: the world of the giants.
</p><p id="n1.1.9"><ab type="parNum"><ref target="lg1.1.9">9</ref>.</ab> Here apparently begins the interpolated catalogue of the dwarfs, running through stanza 16; possibly, however, the interpolated section does not begin before stanza 11. Snorri quotes practically the entire section, the names appearing in a somewhat changed order. <hi>Brimir</hi> and <hi>Blain</hi>: nothing is known of these two giants, and it has been suggested that both are names for Ymir (cf. stanza 3). Brimir, however, appears in stanza 37 in connection with the home of the dwarfs. Some editors treat the words as common rather than proper nouns, Brimir meaning &#8220;the bloody moisture&#8221; and Blain being of uncertain significance.
</p><p id="n1.1.10"><ab type="parNum"><ref target="lg1.1.10">10</ref>.</ab> Very few of the dwarfs named in this and the following stanzas are mentioned elsewhere. It is not clear why Durin should have been singled out as authority for the list. The occasional repetitions suggest that not all the stanzas of the catalogue came from the same source. Most of the names presumably had some definite significance, as Northri, Suthri, Austri, and Vestri (&#8220;North,&#8221; &#8220;South,&#8221; &#8220;East,&#8221; and &#8220;West&#8221;), Althjof <pb id="pb7a" n="7" facs="f:039"/>(&#8220;Mighty Thief&#8221;), Mjothvitnir (&#8220;Mead-Wolf&#8221;), Gandalf (&#8220;Magic Elf&#8221;), Vindalf (&#8220;Wind Elf&#8221;), Rathsvith (&#8220;Swift in Counsel&#8221;), Eikinskjaldi (&#8220;Oak Shield&#8221;), etc., but in many cases the interpretations are sheer guesswork.
</p><p id="n1.1.12"><ab type="parNum"><ref target="lg1.1.12">12</ref>.</ab> The order of the lines in this and the succeeding four stanzas varies greatly in the manuscripts and editions, and the names likewise appear in many forms. <hi>Regin</hi>: probably not identical with Regin the son of Hreithmar, who plays an important part in the <hi>Reginsmol</hi> and <hi>Fafnismol</hi>, but cf. note on <hi>Reginsmol</hi>, introductory prose.
</p><p id="n1.1.14"><ab type="parNum"><ref target="lg1.1.14">14</ref>.</ab> <hi>Dvalin</hi>: in Hovamol, 144, Dvalin seems to have given magic runes to the dwarfs, probably accounting for their skill in craftsmanship, while in <hi>Fafnismol</hi>, 13, he is mentioned as the father of some of the lesser Norns. The story that some of the dwarfs left the rocks and mountains to find a new home on the sands is mentioned, but unexplained, in Snorri&#8217;s <hi>Edda</hi>; of <hi>Lofar</hi> we know only that he was descended from these wanderers.
<pb id="pb8a" n="8" facs="f:040"/></p><p id="n1.1.15"><ab type="parNum"><ref target="lg1.1.15">15</ref>.</ab> <hi>Andvari</hi>: this dwarf appears prominently in the <hi>Reginsmol</hi>, which tells how the god Loki treacherously robbed him of his wealth; the curse which he laid on his treasure brought about the deaths of Sigurth, Gunnar, Atli, and many others.
</p><p id="n1.1.17"><ab type="parNum"><ref target="lg1.1.17">17</ref>.</ab> Here the poem resumes its course after the interpolated section. Probably, however, something has been lost, for there is no apparent connection between the three giant-maids of stanza 8 and the three gods, Othin, H&#246;nir and Lothur, who in stanza 17 go forth to create man and woman. The word &#8220;three&#8221; in stanzas 8 and 17 very likely confused some early reciter, or perhaps the compiler himself. <hi>Ask</hi> and <hi>Embla</hi>: ash and elm; Snorri gives them simply as the names of the first man and woman, but says that the gods made this pair out of trees.
</p><p id="n1.1.18"><ab type="parNum"><ref target="lg1.1.18">18</ref>.</ab> <hi>H&#246;nir</hi>: little is known of this god, save that he occasionally appears in the poems in company with Othin and Loki, and <pb id="pb9a" n="9" facs="f:041"/>that he survives the destruction, assuming in the new age the gift of prophesy (cf. stanza 63). He was given by the gods as a hostage to the Wanes after their war, in exchange for Njorth (cf. stanza 21 and note). <hi>Lothur</hi>: apparently an older name for Loki, the treacherous but ingenious son of Laufey, whose divinity Snorri regards as somewhat doubtful. He was adopted by Othin, who subsequently had good reason to regret it. Loki probably represents the blending of two originally distinct figures, one of them an old fire-god, hence his gift of heat to the newly created pair.
</p><p id="n1.1.19"><ab type="parNum"><ref target="lg1.1.19">19</ref>.</ab> <hi>Yggdrasil</hi>: cf. stanza 2 and note, and <hi>Grimnismol</hi>, 29&#8211;35 and notes. <hi>Urth</hi> (&#8220;The Past&#8221;): one of the three great Norns. The world-ash is kept green by being sprinkled with the marvelous healing water from her well.
</p><p id="n1.1.20"><ab type="parNum"><ref target="lg1.1.20">20</ref>.</ab> <hi>The maidens</hi>: the three Norns; possibly this stanza should follow stanza 8. <hi>Dwelling</hi>: <hi>Regius</hi> has &#8220;s&#230;&#8221; (sea) instead of &#8220;sal&#8221; (hall, home), and many editors have followed this reading, although Snorri&#8217;s prose paraphrase indicates &#8220;sal.&#8221; <hi>Urth</hi>, <hi>Verthandi</hi> and <hi>Skuld</hi>: &#8220;Past,&#8221; &#8220;Present&#8221; and &#8220;Future.&#8221; <hi>Wood</hi>, etc.: the magic signs (runes) controlling the destinies of men were cut on pieces of wood. Lines 3&#8211;4 are probably interpolations from some other account of the Norns.
<pb id="pb10a" n="10" facs="f:042"/></p><p id="n1.1.21"><ab type="parNum"><ref target="lg1.1.21">21</ref>.</ab> This follows stanza 20 in <hi>Regius</hi>; in the <hi>Hauksbok</hi> version stanzas 25, 26, 27, 40 and 41 come between stanzas 20 and 21. Editors have attempted all sorts of rearrangements. <hi>The war</hi>: the first war was that between the gods and the Wanes. The cult of the Wanes (Vanir) seems to have originated among the seafaring folk of the Baltic and the southern shores of the North Sea, and to have spread thence into Norway in opposition to the worship of the older gods; hence the &#8220;war.&#8221; Finally the two types of divinities were worshipped in common; hence the treaty which ended the war with the exchange of hostages. Chief among the Wanes were Njorth and his children, Freyr and Freyja, all of whom became conspicuous among the gods. Beyond this we know little of the Wanes, who seem originally to have been water-deities. <hi>I remember</hi>: the manuscripts have &#8220;she remembers,&#8221; but the Volva is apparently still speaking of her own memories, as in stanza 2. <hi>Gollveig</hi> (&#8220;Gold-Might&#8221;): apparently the first of the Wanes to come among the gods, her ill-treatment being the immediate cause of the war. M&#252;llenhoff maintains that Gollveig is another name for Freyja. Lines 5&#8211;6, one or both of them probably interpolated, seem to symbolize the refining of gold by fire. <hi>Hor</hi> (&#8220;The High One&#8221;): Othin.
</p><p id="n1.1.22"><ab type="parNum"><ref target="lg1.1.22">22</ref>.</ab> <hi>Heith</hi> (&#8220;Shining One&#8221;?): a name often applied to wise-women and prophetesses. The application of this stanza to Gollveig is far from clear, though the reference may be to the <pb id="pb11a" n="11" facs="f:043"/>magic and destructive power of gold. It is also possible that the stanza is an interpolation. Bugge maintains that it applies to the Volva who is reciting the poem, and makes it the opening stanza, following it with stanzas 28 and 30, and then going on with stanzas 1 ff. The text of line 2 is obscure, and has been variously emended.
</p><p id="n1.1.23"><ab type="parNum"><ref target="lg1.1.23">23</ref>.</ab> This stanza and stanza 24 have been transposed from the order in the manuscripts, for the former describes the battle and the victory of the Wanes, after which the gods took council, debating whether to pay tribute to the victors, or to admit them, as was finally done, to equal rights of worship.
</p><p id="n1.1.25"><ab type="parNum"><ref target="lg1.1.25">25</ref>.</ab> Possibly, as Finn Magnusen long ago suggested, there is something lost after stanza 24, but it was not the custom of the Eddic poets to supply transitions which their hearers could generally be counted on to understand. The story referred to in stanzas 25&#8211;26 (both quoted by Snorri) is that of the rebuilding of Asgarth after its destruction by the Wanes. The gods employed a giant as builder, who demanded as his reward the sun and moon, and the goddess Freyja for his wife. The gods, terrified by the rapid progress of the work, forced Loki, who had advised the bargain, to delay the giant by a trick, so that the <pb id="pb12a" n="12" facs="f:044"/>work was not finished in the stipulated time (cf. <hi>Grimnismol</hi>, 44, note). The enraged giant then threatened the gods, whereupon Thor slew him. <hi>Oth&#8217;s bride</hi>: Freyja; of Oth little is known beyond the fact that Snorri refers to him as a man who &#8220;went away on long journeys.&#8221;
</p><p id="n1.1.26"><ab type="parNum"><ref target="lg1.1.26">26</ref>.</ab> <hi>Thor</hi>: the thunder-god, son of Othin and Jorth (Earth); cf. particularly <hi>Harbarthsljoth</hi> and <hi>Thrymskvitha</hi>, <hi>passim</hi>. <hi>Oaths</hi>, etc.: the gods, by violating their oaths to the giant who rebuilt Asgarth, aroused the undying hatred of the giants&#8217; race, and thus the giants were among their enemies in the final battle.
</p><p id="n1.1.27"><ab type="parNum"><ref target="lg1.1.27">27</ref>.</ab> Here the Volva turns from her memories of the past to a statement of some of Othin&#8217;s own secrets in his eternal search for knowledge (stanzas 27&#8211;29). Bugge puts this stanza after stanza 29. <hi>The horn of Heimdall</hi>: the Gjallarhorn (&#8220;Shrieking Horn&#8221;), with which Heimdall, watchman of the gods, will summon them to the last battle. Till that time the horn is buried under Yggdrasil. <hi>Valfather&#8217;s pledge</hi>: Othin&#8217;s eye (the sun?), which he gave to the water-spirit Mimir (or Mim) in exchange for the latter&#8217;s wisdom. It appears here and in stanza 29 as a drinking-vessel, from which Mimir drinks the magic mead, and from which he pours water on the ash Yggdrasil. Othin&#8217;s sacrifice of his eye in order to gain knowledge of his final doom is one of the series of disasters leading up to the destruction of the gods. There were several differing versions of the story of Othin&#8217;s relations with Mimir; another one, quite incompatible with this, appears in stanza 47. In the manuscripts <hi>I know</hi> and <hi>I see</hi> appear as &#8220;she knows&#8221; and &#8220;she sees&#8221; (cf. note on 21).
<pb id="pb13a" n="13" facs="f:045"/></p><p id="n1.1.28"><ab type="parNum"><ref target="lg1.1.28">28</ref>.</ab> The <hi>Hauksbok</hi> version omits all of stanzas 28&#8211;34, stanza 27 being there followed by stanzas 40 and 41. <hi>Regius</hi> indicates stanzas 28 and 29 as a single stanza. Bugge puts stanza 28 after stanza 22, as the second stanza of his reconstructed poem. The Volva here addresses Othin directly, intimating that, although he has not told her, she knows why he has come to her, and what he has already suffered in his search for knowledge regarding his doom. Her reiterated &#8220;would you know yet more?&#8221; seems to mean: &#8220;I have proved my wisdom by telling of the past and of your own secrets; is it your will that I tell likewise of the fate in store for you?&#8221; <hi>The Old One</hi>: Othin.
</p><p id="n1.1.29"><ab type="parNum"><ref target="lg1.1.29">29</ref>.</ab> The first line, not in either manuscript, is a conjectural emendation based on Snorri&#8217;s paraphrase. Bugge puts this stanza after stanza 20.
</p><p id="n1.1.30"><ab type="parNum"><ref target="lg1.1.30">30</ref>.</ab> This is apparently the transitional stanza, in which the Volva, rewarded by Othin for her knowledge of the past (stanzas 1&#8211;29), is induced to proceed with her real prophecy (stanzas 31&#8211;66). Some editors turn the stanza into the third person, making it a narrative link. Bugge, on the other hand, puts it <pb id="pb14a" n="14" facs="f:046"/>after stanza 28 as the third stanza of the poem. No lacuna is indicated in the manuscripts, and editors have attempted various emendations. <hi>Heerfather</hi> (&#8220;Father of the Host&#8221;): Othin.
</p><p id="n1.1.31"><ab type="parNum"><ref target="lg1.1.31">31</ref>.</ab> <hi>Valkyries</hi>: these &#8220;Choosers of the Slain&#8221; (cf. stanza 1, note) bring the bravest warriors killed in battle to Valhall, in order to re-enforce the gods for their final struggle. They are also called &#8220;Wish-Maidens,&#8221; as the fulfillers of Othin&#8217;s wishes. The conception of the supernatural warrior-maiden was presumably brought to Scandinavia in very early times from the South-Germanic races, and later it was interwoven with the likewise South-Germanic tradition of the swan-maiden. A third complication developed when the originally quite human women of the hero-legends were endowed with the qualities of both Valkyries and swan-maidens, as in the cases of Brynhild (cf. <hi>Gripisspo</hi>, introductory note), Svava (cf. <hi>Helgakvitha Hjorvarthssonar</hi>, prose after stanza 5 and note) and Sigrun (cf. <hi>Helgakvitha Hundingsbana</hi> I, 17 and note). The list of names here given may be an interpolation; a quite different list is given in <hi>Grimnismol</hi>, 36. <hi>Ranks of the gods</hi>: some editors regard the word thus translated as a specific place name. <hi>Herjan</hi> (&#8220;Leader of Hosts&#8221;): Othin. It is worth noting that the name <hi>Hild</hi> (&#8220;Warrior&#8221;) is the basis of Bryn-hild (&#8220;Warrior in Mail-Coat&#8221;).
</p><p id="n1.1.32"><ab type="parNum"><ref target="lg1.1.32">32</ref>.</ab> <hi>Baldr</hi>: The death of Baldr, the son of Othin and Frigg, was the first of the great disasters to the gods. The story is fully told by Snorri. Frigg had demanded of all created things, saving only the mistletoe, which she thought too weak to be worth troubling <pb id="pb15a" n="15" facs="f:047"/>about, an oath that they would not harm Baldr. Thus it came to be a sport for the gods to hurl weapons at Baldr, who, of course, was totally unharmed thereby. Loki, the trouble-maker, brought the mistletoe to Baldr&#8217;s blind brother, Hoth, and guided his hand in hurling the twig. Baldr was slain, and grief came upon all the gods. Cf. <hi>Baldrs Draumar</hi>.
</p><p id="n1.1.33"><ab type="parNum"><ref target="lg1.1.33">33</ref>.</ab> The lines in this and the following stanza have been combined in various ways by editors, <corr sic="lacunae">lacun&#230;</corr> having been freely conjectured, but the manuscript version seems clear enough. <hi>The brother of Baldr</hi>: Vali, whom Othin begot expressly to avenge Baldr&#8217;s death. The day after his birth he fought and slew Hoth.
</p><p id="n1.1.34"><ab type="parNum"><ref target="lg1.1.34">34</ref>.</ab> <hi>Frigg</hi>: Othin&#8217;s wife. Some scholars have regarded her as a solar myth, calling her the sun-goddess, and pointing out that her home in <hi>Fensalir</hi> (&#8220;the sea-halls&#8221;) symbolizes the daily setting of the sun beneath the ocean horizon.
</p><p id="n1.1.35"><ab type="parNum"><ref target="lg1.1.35">35</ref>.</ab> The translation here follows the <hi>Regius</hi> version. The <hi>Hauksbok</hi> has the same final two lines, but in place of the first <pb id="pb16a" n="16" facs="f:048"/>pair has, &#8220;I know that Vali &#160;&#160;|&#160;&#160; his brother gnawed, / With his bowels then &#160;&#160;|&#160;&#160; was Loki bound.&#8221; Many editors have followed this version of the whole stanza or have included these two lines, often marking them as doubtful, with the four from <hi>Regius</hi>. After the murder of Baldr, the gods took Loki and bound him to a rock with the bowels of his son Narfi, who had just been torn to pieces by Loki&#8217;s other son, Vali. A serpent was fastened above Loki&#8217;s head, and the venom fell upon his face. Loki&#8217;s wife, <hi>Sigyn</hi>, sat by him with a basin to catch the venom, but whenever the basin was full, and she went away to empty it, then the venom fell on Loki again, till the earth shook with his struggles. &#8220;And there he lies bound till the end.&#8221; Cf. <hi>Lokasenna</hi>, concluding prose.
</p><p id="n1.1.36"><ab type="parNum"><ref target="lg1.1.36">36</ref>.</ab> Stanzas 36&#8211;39 describe the homes of the enemies of the gods: the giants (36), the dwarfs (37), and the dead in the land of the goddess Hel (38&#8211;39). The <hi>Hauksbok</hi> version omits stanzas 36 and 37. <hi>Regius</hi> unites 36 with 37, but most editors have assumed a lacuna. <hi>Slith</hi> (&#8220;the Fearful&#8221;): a river in the giants&#8217; home. The &#8220;swords and daggers&#8221; may represent the icy cold.
</p><p id="n1.1.37"><ab type="parNum"><ref target="lg1.1.37">37</ref>.</ab> <hi>Nithavellir</hi> (&#8220;the Dark Fields&#8221;): a home of the dwarfs. Perhaps the word should be &#8220;Nithafjoll&#8221; (&#8220;the Dark Crags&#8221;). <hi>Sindri</hi>: the great worker in gold among the dwarfs. <hi>Okolnir</hi> <pb id="pb17a" n="17" facs="f:049"/>(&#8220;the Not Cold&#8221;): possibly a volcano. <hi>Brimir</hi>: the giant (possibly Ymir) out of whose blood, according to stanza 9, the dwarfs were made; the name here appears to mean simply the leader of the dwarfs.
</p><p id="n1.1.38"><ab type="parNum"><ref target="lg1.1.38">38</ref>.</ab> Stanzas 38 and 39 follow stanza 43 in the <hi>Hauksbok</hi> version. Snorri quotes stanzas 38, 39, 40 and 41, though not consecutively. <hi>Nastrond</hi> (&#8220;Corpse-Strand&#8221;): the land of the dead, ruled by the goddess Hel. Here the wicked undergo tortures. <hi>Smoke-vent</hi>: the phrase gives a picture of the Icelandic house, with its opening in the roof serving instead of a chimney.
</p><p id="n1.1.39"><ab type="parNum"><ref target="lg1.1.39">39</ref>.</ab> The stanza is almost certainly in corrupt form. The third line is presumably an interpolation, and is lacking in most of the late paper manuscripts. Some editors, however, have called lines 1&#8211;3 the remains of a full stanza, with the fourth line lacking, and lines 4&#8211;5 the remains of another. The stanza depicts the torments of the two worst classes of criminals known to Old Norse morality&#8212;oath-breakers and murderers. <hi>Nithhogg</hi> (&#8220;the Dread Biter&#8221;): the dragon that lies beneath the ash Yggdrasil and gnaws at its roots, thus symbolizing the destructive elements in the universe; cf. <hi>Grimnismol</hi>, 32, 35. <hi>The wolf</hi>: presumably the wolf Fenrir, one of the children of Loki and the giantess Angrbotha (the others being Mithgarthsorm and the goddess Hel), who was chained by the gods with the marvelous chain Gleipnir, fashioned by a dwarf &#8220;out of six things: the <pb id="pb18a" n="18" facs="f:050"/>noise of a cat&#8217;s step, the beards of women, the roots of mountains, the nerves of bears, the breath of fishes, and the spittle of birds.&#8221; The chaining of Fenrir cost the god Tyr his right hand; cf. stanza 44.
</p><p id="n1.1.40"><ab type="parNum"><ref target="lg1.1.40">40</ref>.</ab> The <hi>Hauksbok</hi> version inserts after stanza 39 the refrain-stanza (44), and puts stanzas 40 and 41 between 27 and 21. With this stanza begins the account of the final struggle itself. <hi>The giantess</hi>: her name is nowhere stated, and the only other reference to Ironwood is in <hi>Grimnismol</hi>, 39, in this same connection. The children of this giantess and the wolf Fenrir are the wolves Skoll and Hati, the first of whom steals the sun, the second the moon. Some scholars naturally see here an eclipse-myth.
</p><p id="n1.1.41"><ab type="parNum"><ref target="lg1.1.41">41</ref>.</ab> In the third line many editors omit the comma after &#8220;sun,&#8221; and put one after &#8220;soon,&#8221; making the two lines run: &#8220;Dark grows the sun &#160;&#160;|&#160;&#160; in summer soon, / Mighty storms&#8212;&#8221; etc. Either phenomenon in summer would be sufficiently striking.
</p><p id="n1.1.42"><ab type="parNum"><ref target="lg1.1.42">42</ref>.</ab> In the <hi>Hauksbok</hi> version stanzas 42 and 43 stand between stanzas 44 and 38. <hi>Eggther</hi>: this giant, who seems to be the watchman of the giants, as Heimdall is that of the gods and Surt of the dwellers in the fire-world, is not mentioned elsewhere in <pb id="pb19a" n="19" facs="f:051"/>the poems. <hi>Fjalar</hi>, the cock whose crowing wakes the giants for the final struggle.

</p><p id="n1.1.44"><ab type="parNum"><ref target="lg1.1.44">44</ref>.</ab> This is a refrain-stanza. In <hi>Regius</hi> it appears in full only at this point, but is repeated in abbreviated form before stanzas 50 and 59. In the <hi>Hauksbok</hi> version the full stanza comes first between stanzas 35 and 42, then, in abbreviated form, it occurs four times: before stanzas 45, 50, 55, and 59. In the <hi>Hauksbok</hi> line 3 runs: &#8220;Farther I see &#160;&#160;|&#160;&#160; and more can say.&#8221; <hi>Garm</hi>: the dog who guards the gates of Hel&#8217;s kingdom; cf. <hi>Baldrs Draumar</hi>, 2 ff, and <hi>Grimnismol</hi>, 44. <hi><corr sic="Gniparhellir">Gnipahellir</corr></hi> (&#8220;the Cliff-Cave&#8221;): the entrance to the world of the dead. <hi>The wolf</hi>: Fenrir; cf. stanza 39 and note.
</p><p id="n1.1.45"><ab type="parNum"><ref target="lg1.1.45">45</ref>.</ab> From this point on through stanza 57 the poem is quoted by Snorri, stanza 49 alone being omitted. There has been much discussion as to the status of stanza 45. Lines 4 and 5 look like an interpolation. After line 5 the <hi>Hauksbok</hi> has a line running: &#8220;The world resounds, &#160;&#160;|&#160;&#160; the witch is flying.&#8221; Editors have arranged these seven lines in various ways, with <corr sic="lacunae">lacun&#230;</corr> freely indicated. <hi>Sisters&#8217; sons</hi>: in all Germanic countries the relations between uncle and nephew were felt to be particularly close.

This stanza refers to the story that he was sent by the gods with H&#246;nir as a hostage to the Wanes after their war (cf. stanza 21 and note), and that the Wanes cut off his head and returned it to the gods. Othin embalmed the head, and by magic gave it the power of speech, thus making Mimir&#8217;s noted wisdom always available. Of course this story does not fit with that underlying the references to Mimir in stanzas 27 and 29. <hi>The kinsman of Surt</hi>: the wolf <pb id="pb21a" n="21" facs="f:053"/>Fenrir, who slays Othin in the final struggle; cf. stanza 53.

In <hi>Regius</hi> only lines 1 and 4 are found, combined with stanza 56 as a single stanza. Line 1 does not appear in the <hi>Hauksbok</hi> version, the stanza there beginning with line 2. Snorri, in quoting these two stanzas, omits 55, 2&#8211;4, and 56, 3, making a single stanza out of 55, 1, and 56, 4, 2, 1, in that order. Moreover, the <hi>Hauksbok</hi> manuscript at this point is practically illegible. The lacuna (line 3) is, of course, purely conjectural, and all sorts of arrangements of the lines have been attempted by editors. <hi>Hlothyn</hi>: another name for Jorth (&#8220;Earth&#8221;), Thor&#8217;s mother; his father was Othin. <hi>The snake</hi>: Mithgarthsorm; cf. stanza 5c and note. <hi>Othin&#8217;s son</hi>: Thor. The fourth line in <hi>Regius</hi> reads &#8220;against the wolf,&#8221; but if this line refers to Thor at all, and not to Vithar, the <hi>Hauksbok</hi> reading, &#8220;serpent,&#8221; is correct.

Snorri&#8217;s description of this second hall is based on <hi>Voluspo</hi>, 38, which he quotes, and perhaps that stanza properly belongs after 64.

It has been suggested that the dragon, making a last attempt to rise, is destroyed, this event marking the end of evil in the world. But in both manuscripts the final half-line does not refer to the dragon, but, as the gender shows, to the Volva herself, who sinks into the earth; a sort of conclusion to the entire prophecy. Presumably the stanza (barring the last half-line, which was probably intended as the conclusion of the poem) belongs somewhere in the description of the great struggle. <hi>Nithhogg</hi>: the dragon at the roots of Yggdrasil; cf. stanza 39 and note. <hi>Nithafjoll</hi> (&#8220;the Dark Crags&#8221;); nowhere else mentioned. <hi>Must I</hi>: the manuscripts have &#8220;must she.&#8221;

The first stanza is quoted by Snorri, and two lines of stanza 84 appear in one of the sagas.
</p><p>In its present shape it involves the critic of the text in more puzzles than any other of the Eddic poems. Without going in detail into the various theories, what happened seems to have been somewhat as follows. There existed from very early times a collection of proverbs and wise counsels, which were attributed to Othin just as the Biblical proverbs were to Solomon. This collection, which presumably was always elastic in extent, was known as &#8220;The High One&#8217;s Words,&#8221; and forms the basis of the present poem. To it, however, were added other poems and fragments dealing with wisdom which seemed by their nature to imply that the speaker was Othin. Thus a catalogue of runes, or charms, was tacked on, and also a set of proverbs, differing essentially in form from those comprising the main collection. Here and there bits of verse more nearly narrative crept in; and of course the loose structure of the poem made it easy for any reciter to insert new stanzas almost at will. This curious miscellany is what we now have as the <hi>Hovamol</hi>.
</p><p>Five separate elements are pretty clearly recognizable: (1) the <hi>Hovamol</hi> proper (stanzas 1&#8211;80), a collection of proverbs and counsels for the conduct of life; (2) the <hi>Loddfafnismol</hi> (stanzas 111&#8211;138), a collection somewhat similar to the first, but specifically addressed to a certain Loddfafnir; (3) the <hi>Ljothatal</hi> (stanzas 147&#8211;165), a collection of charms; (4) the love-story of Othin and Billing&#8217;s daughter (stanzas 96&#8211;102), with an introductory dissertation on the faithlessness of women in general (stanzas 81&#8211;95), which probably crept into the poem first, and then pulled the story, as an apt illustration, after it; (5) the story of how Othin got the mead of poetry&#8212;the draught which gave him the gift of tongues&#8212;from the maiden Gunnloth (stanzas 103&#8211;110). There is also a brief passage (stanzas 139&#8211;146) telling how Othin won the runes, this passage being a natural introduction to the <hi>Ljothatal</hi>, and doubtless brought into the poem for that reason.
<pb id="pb29" n="29" facs="f:061"/></p><p>It is idle to discuss the authorship or date of such a series of accretions as this. Parts of it are doubtless among the oldest relics of ancient Germanic poetry; parts of it may have originated at a relatively late period. Probably, however, most of its component elements go pretty far back, although we have no way of telling how or when they first became associated.
</p><p>It seems all but meaningless to talk about &#8220;interpolations&#8221; in a poem which has developed almost solely through the process of piecing together originally unrelated odds and ends. The notes, therefore, make only such suggestions as are needed to keep the main divisions of the poem distinct.
</p><p>Few gnomic collections in the world&#8217;s literary history present sounder wisdom more tersely expressed than the <hi>Hovamol</hi>. Like the Book of Proverbs it occasionally rises to lofty heights of poetry. If it presents the worldly wisdom of a violent race, it also shows noble ideals of loyalty, truth, and unfaltering courage.</p></div2><div2 type="Section"><lg id="lg1.2.1" type="Verse"><l><ab type="verseNum"><ref target="n1.2.1">1</ref>.</ab> Within the gates &#160;&#160;|&#160;&#160; ere a man shall go,

The two lines of stanza 73 not only appear out of place, but the verse-form is unlike that of the surrounding stanzas. In 74, the second line is clearly interpolated, and line 1 has little enough connection with lines 3, 4 and 5. It looks as though some compiler (or copyist) had inserted here various odds and ends for which he could find no better place.
</p><p id="n1.2.75"><ab type="parNum"><ref target="lg1.2.75">75</ref>.</ab> The word &#8220;gold&#8221; in line 2 is more or less conjectural, the manuscript being obscure. The reading in line 4 is also doubtful.
<pb id="pb44a" n="44" facs="f:076"/></p><p id="n1.2.76"><ab type="parNum"><ref target="lg1.2.76">76</ref>.</ab> In the manuscript this stanza follows 78, the order being: 77, 78, 76, 80, 79, 81. <hi>Fitjung</hi> (&#8220;the Nourisher&#8221;): Earth.
</p><p id="n1.2.79"><ab type="parNum"><ref target="lg1.2.79">79</ref>.</ab> This stanza is certainly in bad shape, and probably out of place here. Its reference to runes as magic signs suggests that it properly belongs in some list of charms like the <hi>Ljothatal</hi> (stanzas 147&#8211;165). The stanza-form is so irregular as to show either that something has been lost or that there have been interpolations. The manuscript indicates no lacuna; Gering fills out the assumed gap as follows:
</p><lg type="Verse"><l>&#8220;Certain is that &#160;&#160;|&#160;&#160; which is sought from runes,
      </l><l rend="indent(2)">The runes&#8212;,&#8221; etc.</l></lg><pb id="pb45a" n="45" facs="f:077"/><p id="n1.2.81"><ab type="parNum"><ref target="lg1.2.81">81</ref>.</ab> With this stanza the verse-form, as indicated in the translation, abruptly changes to Malahattr. What has happened seems to have been something like this. Stanza 80 introduces the idea of man&#8217;s love for woman. Consequently some reciter or compiler (or possibly even a copyist) took occasion to insert at this point certain stanzas concerning the ways of women. Thus stanza 80 would account for the introduction of stanzas 81 and 82, which, in turn, apparently drew stanza 83 in with them. Stanza 84 suggests the fickleness of women, and is immediately followed&#8212;again with a change of verse-form&#8212;by a list of things equally untrustworthy (stanzas 85&#8211;90). Then, after a few more stanzas on love in the regular measure of the <hi>Hovamol</hi> (stanzas 91&#8211;95), is introduced, by way of illustration, Othin&#8217;s story of his <pb id="pb46a" n="46" facs="f:078"/>adventure with Billing&#8217;s daughter (stanzas 96&#8211;102). Some such process of growth, whatever its specific stages may have been, must be assumed to account for the curious chaos of the whole passage from stanza 81 to stanza 102.
</p><p id="n1.2.84"><ab type="parNum"><ref target="lg1.2.84">84</ref>.</ab> Lines 3 and 4 are quoted in the <hi>Fostbr&#230;thrasaga</hi>.

</p><p id="n1.2.87"><ab type="parNum"><ref target="lg1.2.87">87</ref>.</ab> The stanza is doubtless incomplete. Some editors add from a late paper manuscript two lines running:
</p><lg type="Verse"><l>&#8220;In a light, clear sky &#160;&#160;|&#160;&#160; or a laughing throng,
    </l><l>In the howl of a dog &#160;&#160;|&#160;&#160; or a harlot&#8217;s grief.&#8221;</l></lg><pb id="pb47a" n="47" facs="f:079"/><p id="n1.2.88"><ab type="parNum"><ref target="lg1.2.88">88</ref>.</ab> This stanza follows stanza 89 in the manuscript. Many editors have changed the order, for while stanza 89 is pretty clearly an interpolation wherever it stands, it seriously interferes with the sense if it breaks in between 87 and 88.
<pb id="pb48a" n="48" facs="f:080"/></p><p id="n1.2.96"><ab type="parNum"><ref target="lg1.2.96">96</ref>.</ab> Here begins the passage (stanzas 96&#8211;102) illustrating the falseness of woman by the story of Othin&#8217;s unsuccessful love-affair with Billing&#8217;s daughter.

<pb id="pb49a" n="49" facs="f:081"/></p><p id="n1.2.102"><ab type="parNum"><ref target="lg1.2.102">102</ref>.</ab> Rask adds at the beginning of this stanza two lines from a late paper manuscript, running:

</p><p id="n1.2.104"><ab type="parNum"><ref target="lg1.2.104">104</ref>.</ab> The giant <hi>Suttung</hi> (&#8220;the old giant&#8221;) possessed the magic mead, a draught of which conferred the gift of poetry. Othin, desiring to obtain it, changed himself into a snake, bored his way through a mountain into Suttung&#8217;s home, made love to the giant&#8217;s daughter, Gunnloth, and by her connivance drank up all the mead. Then he flew away in the form of an eagle, leaving Gunnloth to her fate. While with Suttung he assumed the name of Bolverk (&#8220;the Evil-Doer&#8221;).

Othin had no intention of bestowing any of the precious mead upon men, but as he was flying over the earth, hotly pursued by Suttung, he spilled some of it out of his mouth, and in this way mankind also won the gift of poetry.

The frost-giants, Suttung&#8217;s kinsmen, appear not to have suspected Othin of being <pb id="pb52a" n="52" facs="f:084"/>identical with Bolverk, possibly because the oath referred to in stanza 110 was an oath made by Othin to Suttung that there was no such person as Bolverk among the gods. The giants, of course, fail to get from Othin the information they seek concerning Bolverk, but Othin is keenly conscious of having violated the most sacred of oaths, that sworn on his ring.
</p><p id="n1.2.111"><ab type="parNum"><ref target="lg1.2.111">111</ref>.</ab> With this stanza begins the Loddfafnismol (stanzas 111&#8211;138). Loddfafnir is apparently a wandering singer, who, from his &#8220;chanter&#8217;s stool,&#8221; recites the verses which he claims to have received from Othin. <hi>Wells of Urth</hi>: cf. <hi>Voluspo</hi>, 19 and note. Urth (&#8220;the Past&#8221;) is one of the three Norns. This stanza is apparently in corrupt form, and editors have tried many experiments with it, both in rejecting lines as spurious and in rearranging the words and punctuation. It looks rather as though the first four lines formed a complete stanza, and the last four had <pb id="pb53a" n="53" facs="f:085"/>crept in later. The phrase translated &#8220;the speech of Hor&#8221; is &#8220;Hova mol,&#8221; later used as the title for the entire poem.
</p><p id="n1.2.112"><ab type="parNum"><ref target="lg1.2.112">112</ref>.</ab> Lines 1&#8211;3 are the formula, repeated (abbreviated in the manuscript) in most of the stanzas, with which Othin prefaces his counsels to Loddfafnir, and throughout this section, except in stanzas 111 and 138, Loddfafnir represents himself as simply quoting Othin&#8217;s words. The material is closely analogous to that contained in the first eighty stanzas of the poem. In some cases (e.g., stanzas 117, 119, 121, 126 and 130) the formula precedes a full four-line stanza instead of two (or three) lines.

Others, attaching lines 3 and 4 to stanza 132, insert as the first two lines of stanza 133 two lines from a late paper manuscript, running:

The beam (bolt) which is ever being raised to admit guests becomes weak thereby.

Most recent editors have followed M&#252;llenhoff in shifting it to this position, as it appears to conclude the passage introduced by the somewhat similar stanza III.
</p><p id="n1.2.139"><ab type="parNum"><ref target="lg1.2.139">139</ref>.</ab> With this stanza begins the most confusing part of the <hi>Hovamol</hi>: the group of eight stanzas leading up to the <hi>Ljothatal</hi>, or list of charms. Certain paper manuscripts have before this stanza a title: &#8220;Othin&#8217;s Tale of the Runes.&#8221; Apparently stanzas 139, 140 and 142 are fragments of an account of how Othin obtained the runes; 141 is erroneously inserted from some version of the magic mead story (cf. stanzas 104&#8211;110); and stanzas 143, 144, 145, and 146 are from miscellaneous sources, all, however, dealing with the general subject of runes. With stanza 147 a clearly continuous passage begins once more. <hi>The windy tree</hi>: the ash Yggdrasil (literally &#8220;the Horse of Othin,&#8221; so called because of this story), on which Othin, in order to win the magic runes, hanged himself as an offering to himself, and wounded himself with his own spear. Lines 5 and 6 have presumably been borrowed from <hi>Svipdagsmol</hi>, 30.
<pb id="pb61a" n="61" facs="f:093"/></p><p id="n1.2.141"><ab type="parNum"><ref target="lg1.2.141">141</ref>.</ab> This stanza, interrupting as it does the account of Othin&#8217;s winning the runes, appears to be an interpolation. The meaning of the stanza is most obscure. Bolthorn was Othin&#8217;s grandfather, and Bestla his mother. We do not know the name of the uncle here mentioned, but it has been suggested that this son of Bolthorn was Mimir (cf. <hi>Voluspo</hi>, 27 and note, and 47 and note). In any case, the nine magic songs which he learned from his uncle seem to have enabled him to win the magic mead (cf. stanzas 104&#8211;110). Concerning <hi>Othr&#246;rir</hi>, here used as the name of the vessel containing the mead, cf. stanza 107 and note.
</p><p id="n1.2.143"><ab type="parNum"><ref target="lg1.2.143">143</ref>.</ab> This and the following stanza belong together, and in many editions appear as a single stanza. They presumably come from some lost poem on the authorship of the runes. Lines 2 and 3 follow line 4 in the manuscript; the transposition was suggested by Bugge. <hi>The king of singers</hi>: Othin. The magic signs (runes) were commonly carved in wood, then colored red.
<pb id="pb62a" n="62" facs="f:094"/></p><p id="n1.2.144"><ab type="parNum"><ref target="lg1.2.144">144</ref>.</ab> <hi>Dain</hi> and <hi>Dvalin</hi>: dwarfs; cf. <hi>Voluspo</hi>, 14, and note. Dain, however, may here be one of the elves rather than the dwarf of that name. The two names also appear together in <hi>Grimnismol</hi>, 33, where they are applied to two of the four harts that nibble at the topmost twigs of Yggdrasil. <hi>Alsvith</hi> (&#8220;the All-Wise&#8221;) appears nowhere else as a giant&#8217;s name. <hi>Myself</hi>: Othin. We have no further information concerning the list of those who wrote the runes for the various races, and these four lines seem like a confusion of names in the rather hazy mind of some reciter.
</p><p id="n1.2.145"><ab type="parNum"><ref target="lg1.2.145">145</ref>.</ab> This Malahattr stanza appears to be a regular religious formula, concerned less with the runes which one &#8220;writes&#8221; and &#8220;tints&#8221; (cf. stanza 79) than with the prayers which one &#8220;asks&#8221; and the sacrifices which one &#8220;offers&#8221; and &#8220;sends.&#8221; Its origin is wholly uncertain, but it is clearly an interpolation here. In the manuscript the phrase &#8220;knowest?&#8221; is abbreviated after the first line.
<pb id="pb63a" n="63" facs="f:095"/></p><p id="n1.2.146"><ab type="parNum"><ref target="lg1.2.146">146</ref>.</ab> This stanza as translated here follows the manuscript reading, except in assuming a gap between lines 3 and 5. In Vigfusson and Powell&#8217;s <hi lang="la" xml:lang="la">Corpus Poeticum Boreale</hi> the first three lines have somehow been expanded into eight. The last two lines are almost certainly misplaced; Bugge suggests that they belong at the end of stanza 144. <hi>Thund</hi>: another name for Othin. <hi>When home he came</hi>: presumably after obtaining the runes as described in stanzas 139 and 140.
</p><p id="n1.2.147"><ab type="parNum"><ref target="lg1.2.147">147</ref>.</ab> With this stanza begins the <hi>Ljothatal</hi>, or list of charms. The magic songs themselves are not given, but in each case the peculiar application of the charm is explained. The passage, which is certainly approximately complete as far as it goes, runs to the end of the poem. In the manuscript and in most editions line 4 falls into two half-lines, running:
</p><lg type="Verse"><l>&#8220;In sickness and pain &#160;&#160;|&#160;&#160; and every sorrow.&#8221;</l></lg><pb id="pb64a" n="64" facs="f:096"/><p id="n1.2.148"><ab type="parNum"><ref target="lg1.2.148">148</ref>.</ab> <hi>Second</hi>, etc., appear in the manuscript as Roman numerals.

From stanza 20 on it is also included in the <hi>Arnamagn&#230;an Codex</hi>, the first part evidently having appeared on a leaf now lost. Snorri quotes eight stanzas of it in the <hi>Prose Edda</hi>, and in his prose text closely paraphrases many others.
</p><p>The poem is wholly in dialogue form except for a single narrative stanza (stanza 5). After a brief introductory discussion between Othin and his wife, Frigg, concerning the reputed wisdom of the giant Vafthruthnir, Othin, always in quest of wisdom, seeks out the giant, calling himself Gagnrath. The giant immediately insists that they shall demonstrate which is the wiser of the two, and propounds four questions (stanzas 11, 13, 15, and 17), each of which Othin answers. It is then the god&#8217;s turn to ask, and he begins with a series of twelve numbered questions regarding the origins and past history of life. These Vafthruthnir answers, and Othin asks five more questions, this time referring to what is to follow the destruction of the gods, the last one asking the name of his own slayer. Again Vafthruthnir answers, and Othin finally propounds the unanswerable question: &#8220;What spake Othin himself in the ears of his son, ere in the bale-fire he burned?&#8221; Vafthruthnir, recognizing his questioner as Othin himself, admits his inferiority in wisdom, and so the contest ends.
</p><p>The whole poem is essentially encyclop&#230;dic in character, and thus was particularly useful to Snorri in his preparation of the <hi>Prose Edda</hi>. The encyclop&#230;dic poem with a slight narrative outline seems to have been exceedingly popular; the <hi>Grimnismol</hi> and the much later <hi>Alvissmol</hi> represent different phases of the same type. The <hi>Vafthruthnismol</hi> and <hi>Grimnismol</hi> together, indeed, constitute a fairly complete dictionary of Norse mythology. There has been much discussion as to the probable date of the <hi>Vafthruthnismol</hi>, but it appears to belong to about the same period as the <hi>Voluspo</hi>: in other words, the middle of the tenth century. While there may be a few interpolated passages in the poem as we now have it, it is clearly a united whole, and evidently in relatively good condition.</p></div2><div2 type="Section"><pb id="pb69" n="69" facs="f:101"/><p><hi>Othin spake</hi>:

Snorri quotes over twenty of its stanzas.
</p><p>Like the preceding poem, the <hi>Grimnismol</hi> is largely <corr sic="encyclopedic">encyclop&#230;dic</corr> in nature, and consists chiefly of proper names, the last forty-seven stanzas containing no less than two hundred and twenty-five of these. It is not, however, in dialogue form. As M&#252;llenhoff pointed out, there is underneath the catalogue of mythological names a consecutive and thoroughly dramatic story. Othin, concealed under the name of Grimnir, is through an error tortured by King Geirr&#246;th. Bound between two blazing fires, he begins to display his wisdom for the benefit of the king&#8217;s little son, Agnar, who has been kind to him. Gradually he works up to the great final moment, when he declares his true name, or rather names, to the terrified Geirr&#246;th, and the latter falls on his sword and is killed.
</p><p>For much of this story we do not have to depend on guesswork, for in both manuscripts the poem itself is preceded by a prose narrative of considerable length, and concluded by a brief prose statement of the manner of Geirr&#246;th&#8217;s death. These prose notes, of which there are many in the Eddic manuscripts, are of considerable interest to the student of early literary forms. Presumably they were written by the compiler to whom we owe the Eddic collection, who felt that the poems needed such annotation in order to be clear. Linguistic evidence shows that they were written in the twelfth or thirteenth century, for they preserve none of the older word-forms which help us to date many of the poems two or three hundred years earlier.
</p><p>Without discussing in detail the problems suggested by these prose passages, it is worth noting, first, that the Eddic poems contain relatively few stanzas of truly narrative verse; and second, that all of them are based on narratives which must have been more or less familiar to the hearers of the poems. In other words, the poems seldom aimed to tell stories, although most of them followed a narrative sequence of ideas. The stories <pb id="pb85" n="85" facs="f:117"/>themselves appear to have lived in oral prose tradition, just as in the case of the sagas; and the prose notes of the manuscripts, in so far as they contain material not simply drawn from the poems themselves, are relics of this tradition. The early Norse poets rarely conceived verse as a suitable means for direct story-telling, and in some of the poems even the simplest action is told in prose &#8220;links&#8221; between dialogue stanzas.
</p><p>The applications of this fact, which has been too often overlooked, are almost limitless, for it suggests a still unwritten chapter in the history of ballad poetry and the so-called &#8220;popular&#8221; epic. It implies that narrative among early peoples may frequently have had a period of prose existence before it was made into verse, and thus puts, for example, a long series of transitional stages before such a poem as the <hi>Iliad</hi>. In any case, the prose notes accompanying the Eddic poems prove that in addition to the poems themselves there existed in the twelfth century a considerable amount of narrative tradition, presumably in prose form, on which these notes were based by the compiler.
</p><p>Interpolations in such a poem as the <hi>Grimnismol</hi> could have been made easily enough, and many stanzas have undoubtedly crept in from other poems, but the beginning and end of the poem are clearly marked, and presumably it has come down to us with the same essential outline it had when it was composed, probably in the first half of the tenth century.</p></div2><div2 type="Section"><milestone rend="dots" unit="tb"/><p id="p1.4.prose">King Hrauthung had two sons: one was called Agnar, and the other Geirr&#246;th. Agnar was ten winters old, and Geirr&#246;th eight. Once they both rowed in a boat with their fishing-gear to catch little fish; and the wind drove them out into the sea. In the darkness of the night they were wrecked on the shore; and going up, they found a poor peasant, with whom they stayed through the winter. The housewife took care of Agnar, and the peasant cared for <pb id="pb86" n="86" facs="f:118"/>Geirr&#246;th, and taught him wisdom. In the spring the peasant gave him a boat; and when the couple led them to the shore, the peasant spoke secretly with Geirr&#246;th. They had a fair wind, and came to their father&#8217;s landing-place. Geirr&#246;th was forward in the boat; he leaped up on land, but pushed out the boat and said, &#8220;Go thou now where evil may have thee!&#8221; The boat drifted out to sea. Geirr&#246;th, however, went up to the house, and was well received, but his father was dead. Then Geirr&#246;th was made king, and became a renowned man.
</p><p>Othin and Frigg sat in Hlithskjolf and looked over all the worlds. Othin said: &#8220;Seest thou Agnar, thy fosterling, how he begets children with a giantess in the cave? But Geirr&#246;th, my fosterling, is a king, and now rules over his land.&#8221; Frigg said: &#8220;He is so miserly that he tortures his guests if he thinks that too many of them come to him.&#8221; Othin replied that this was the greatest of lies; and they made a wager about this matter. Frigg sent her maid-servant, Fulla, to Geirr&#246;th. She bade the king beware lest a magician who was come thither to his land should bewitch him, and told this sign concerning him, that no dog was so fierce as to leap at him. Now it was a very great slander that King Geirr&#246;th was not hospitable; but nevertheless he had them take the man whom the dogs would not attack. He wore a dark-blue mantle and called himself Grimnir, but said no more about himself, though <pb id="pb87" n="87" facs="f:119"/>he was questioned. The king had him tortured to make him speak, and set him between two fires, and he sat there eight nights. King Geirr&#246;th had a son ten winters old, and called Agnar after his father&#8217;s brother. Agnar went to Grimnir, and gave him a full horn to drink from, and said that the king did ill in letting him be tormented without cause. Grimnir drank from the horn; the fire had come so near that the mantle burned on Grimnir&#8217;s back. He spake:

She wished to live in her father&#8217;s hall among the mountains, while Njorth loved his home, Noatun, by the sea. They agreed to compromise by spending nine nights at Thrymheim and then three at Noatun, but neither could endure the surroundings of the other&#8217;s home, so Skathi returned to Thrymheim, while Njorth stayed at Noatun.

In this stanza the two functions of Heimdall&#8212;as father of mankind (cf. <hi>Voluspo</hi>, 1 and note, and <hi>Rigsthula</hi>, introductory prose and note) and as warder of the gods&#8212;seem both to be mentioned, but the second line in the manuscripts is apparently in bad shape, and in the editions is more or less conjectural.

Freyja, the sister of Freyr, is the fairest of the goddesses, and the most kindly disposed to mankind, especially to lovers. <hi>Half of the dead</hi>: Mogk has made it clear that Freyja represents a confusion between two originally distinct divinities: the wife of Othin (Frigg) and the northern goddess of love. This passage appears to have in mind her attributes as Othin&#8217;s wife. Snorri has this same confusion, but there is no reason why the Freyja who was Freyr&#8217;s sister should share the slain with Othin.

</p><p id="n1.4.24"><ab type="parNum"><ref target="lg1.4.24">24</ref>.</ab> This stanza is almost certainly an interpolation, brought in through a confusion of the first two lines with those of stanza 23. Its description of Thor&#8217;s house, Bilskirnir (cf. stanza 4 and <pb id="pb94a" n="94" facs="f:126"/>note) has nothing to do with that of Valhall. Snorri quotes the stanza in his account of Thor.
</p><p id="n1.4.25"><ab type="parNum"><ref target="lg1.4.25">25</ref>.</ab> The first line in the original is, as indicated in the translation, too long, and various attempts to amend it have been made. <hi>Heithrun</hi>: the she-goat who lives on the twigs of the tree <hi>L&#230;rath</hi> (presumably the ash Yggdrasil), and daily gives mead which, like the boar&#8217;s flesh, suffices for all the heroes in Valhall. In Snorri&#8217;s <hi>Edda</hi> Gangleri foolishly asks whether the heroes drink water, whereto Har replies, &#8220;Do you imagine that Othin invites kings and earls and other noble men, and then gives them water to drink?&#8221;
</p><p id="n1.4.26"><ab type="parNum"><ref target="lg1.4.26">26</ref>.</ab> <hi>Eikthyrnir</hi> (&#8220;The Oak-Thorned,&#8221; i.e., with antlers, &#8220;thorns,&#8221; like an oak): this animal presumably represents the clouds. The first line, like that of stanza 25, is too long in the original. <hi>L&#230;rath</hi>: cf. stanza 25, note. <hi>Hvergelmir</hi>: according to Snorri, this spring, &#8220;the Cauldron-Roaring,&#8221; was in the midst of Niflheim, the world of darkness and the dead, beneath the third root of the ash Yggdrasil. Snorri gives a list of the rivers flowing thence nearly identical with the one in the poem.
<pb id="pb95a" n="95" facs="f:127"/></p><p id="n1.4.27"><ab type="parNum"><ref target="lg1.4.27">27</ref>.</ab> The entire passage from stanza 27 through stanza 35 is confused. The whole thing may well be an interpolation. Bugge calls stanzas 27&#8211;30 an interpolation, and editors who have accepted the passage as a whole have rejected various lines. The spelling of the names of the rivers varies greatly in the manuscripts and editions. It is needless here to point out the many attempted emendations of this list. For a passage presenting similar problems, cf. <hi>Voluspo</hi>, 10&#8211;16. Snorri virtually quotes stanzas 27&#8211;28 in his prose, though not consecutively. The name <hi>Rin</hi>, in line 3, is identical with that for the River Rhine which appears frequently in the hero poems, but the similarity is doubtless purely accidental.
</p><p id="n1.4.28"><ab type="parNum"><ref target="lg1.4.28">28</ref>.</ab> <hi>Slith</hi> may possibly be the same river as that mentioned in <hi>Voluspo</hi>, 36, as flowing through the giants&#8217; land. <hi>Leipt</hi>: in <hi>Helgakvitha Hundingsbana</hi> II, 29, this river is mentioned as one by which a solemn oath is sworn, and Gering points the parallel to the significance of the Styx among the Greeks. The other rivers here named are not mentioned elsewhere in the poems.
<pb id="pb96a" n="96" facs="f:128"/></p><p id="n1.4.29"><ab type="parNum"><ref target="lg1.4.29">29</ref>.</ab> This stanza looks as though it originally had had nothing to do with the two preceding it. Snorri quotes it in his description of the three roots of Yggdrasil, and the three springs beneath them. &#8220;The third root of the ash stands in heaven and beneath this root is a spring which is very holy, and is called Urth&#8217;s well.&#8221; (Cf. <hi>Voluspo</hi>, 19) &#8220;There the gods have their judgment-seat, and thither they ride each day over Bifrost, which is also called the Gods&#8217; Bridge.&#8221; Thor has to go on foot in the last days of the destruction, when the bridge is burning. Another interpretation, however, is that when Thor leaves the heavens (i.e., when a thunder-storm is over) the rainbow-bridge becomes hot in the sun. Nothing more is known of the rivers named in this stanza. Lines 3&#8211;4 are almost certainly interpolated from stanza 30.
</p><p id="n1.4.30"><ab type="parNum"><ref target="lg1.4.30">30</ref>.</ab> This stanza, again possibly an interpolation, is closely paraphrased by Snorri following the passage quoted in the previous note. <hi>Glath</hi> (&#8220;Joyous&#8221;): identified in the <hi>Skaldskaparmal</hi> with Skinfaxi, the horse of day; cf. <hi>Vafthruthnismol</hi>, 12. <hi>Gyllir</hi>: &#8220;Golden.&#8221; <hi>Gler</hi>: &#8220;Shining.&#8221; <hi>Skeithbrimir</hi>: &#8220;Swift-Going.&#8221; <hi>Silfrintopp</hi>: &#8220;Silver-Topped.&#8221; <hi>Sinir</hi>: &#8220;Sinewy.&#8221; <hi>Gisl</hi>: the meaning is doubtful; Gering suggests &#8220;Gleaming.&#8221; <hi>Falhofnir</hi>: <pb id="pb97a" n="97" facs="f:129"/>&#8220;Hollow-Hoofed.&#8221; <hi>Golltopp</hi> (&#8220;Gold-Topped&#8221;): this horse belonged to Heimdall (cf. <hi>Voluspo</hi>, 1 and 46). It is noteworthy that gold was one of the attributes of Heimdall&#8217;s belongings, and, because his teeth were of gold, he was also called Gullintanni (&#8220;Gold-Toothed&#8221;). <hi>Lettfeti</hi>: &#8220;Light-Feet.&#8221; Othin&#8217;s eight-footed horse, Sleipnir, is not mentioned in this list.
</p><p id="n1.4.31"><ab type="parNum"><ref target="lg1.4.31">31</ref>.</ab> The first of these roots is the one referred to in stanza 26; the second in stanza 29 (cf. notes). Of the third root there is nothing noteworthy recorded. After this stanza it is more than possible that one has been lost, paraphrased in the prose of Snorri&#8217;s <hi>Edda</hi> thus: &#8220;An eagle sits in the branches of the ash-tree, and he is very wise; and between his eyes sits the hawk who is called Vethrfolnir.&#8221;
</p><p id="n1.4.32"><ab type="parNum"><ref target="lg1.4.32">32</ref>.</ab> <hi>Ratatosk</hi> (&#8220;The Swift-Tusked&#8221;): concerning this squirrel, the <hi>Prose Edda</hi> has to add only that he runs up and down the tree conveying the abusive language of the eagle (see note on stanza 31) and the dragon <hi>Nithhogg</hi> (cf. <hi>Voluspo</hi>, 39 and note) to each other. The hypothesis that Ratatosk &#8220;represents the undying hatred between the sustaining and the destroying elements&#8212;the gods and the giants,&#8221; seems a trifle far-fetched.
</p><p id="n1.4.33"><ab type="parNum"><ref target="lg1.4.33">33</ref>.</ab> Stanzas 33&#8211;34 may well be interpolated, and are certainly in bad shape in the Mss. Bugge points out that they are probably of later origin than those surrounding them. Snorri <pb id="pb98a" n="98" facs="f:130"/>closely paraphrases stanza 33, but without elaboration, and nothing further is known of the <hi>four harts</hi>. It may be guessed, however, that they are a late multiplication of the single hart mentioned in stanza 26, just as the list of dragons in stanza 34 seems to have been expanded out of Nithhogg, the only authentic dragon under the root of the ash. <hi>Highest twigs</hi>: a guess; the Mss. words are baffling. Something has apparently been lost from lines 3&#8211;4, but there is no clue as to its nature.
</p><p id="n1.4.34"><ab type="parNum"><ref target="lg1.4.34">34</ref>.</ab> Cf. note on previous stanza. Nothing further is known of any of the serpents here listed, and the meanings of many of the names are conjectural. Snorri quotes this stanza. Editors have altered it in various ways in an attempt to regularize the meter. <hi>Goin</hi> and <hi>Moin</hi>: meaning obscure. <hi>Grafvitnir</hi>: &#8220;The Gnawing Wolf.&#8221; <hi>Grabak</hi>: &#8220;Gray-Back.&#8221; <hi>Grafvolluth</hi>: &#8220;The Field-Gnawer.&#8221; <hi>Ofnir</hi> and <hi>Svafnir</hi> (&#8220;The Bewilderer&#8221; and &#8220;The Sleep-Bringer&#8221;): it is noteworthy that in stanza 54 Othin gives himself these two names.

According to Snorri: &#8220;There was a man called Mundilfari, who had two children; they were so fair and lovely that he called his son Mani and his daughter Sol. The gods were angry at this presumption, and took the children and set them up in heaven; and they bade Sol drive the horses that drew the car of the sun <pb id="pb100a" n="100" facs="f:132"/>which the gods had made to light the world from the sparks which flew out of Muspellsheim.

This stanza is closely parallel to <hi>Vafthruthnismol</hi>, 21, which see, as also <hi>Voluspo</hi>, 3. Snorri, following this account, has a few details to add. The stones were made out of Ymir&#8217;s teeth and such of his bones as were broken. Mithgarth was a mountain-wall made out of Ymir&#8217;s eyebrows, and set around the earth because of the enmity of the giants.

He calls down a blessing on the man who will reach into the fire and pull aside the great kettle which, in Icelandic houses, hung directly under the smoke-vent in the roof, and thus kept any one above from looking down into the interior. On <hi>Ull</hi>, the archer-god, cf. stanza 5 and note. He is specified here apparently for no better reason than that his name fits the initial-rhyme.

This stanza is quoted by Snorri. <hi>Ivaldi</hi> (&#8220;The Mighty&#8221;): he is known only as the father of the craftsmen-dwarfs who made not only the ship Skithblathnir, but also Othin&#8217;s spear Gungnir, and the golden hair for Thor&#8217;s wife, Sif, after Loki had maliciously cut her own hair off. <hi>Skithblathnir</hi>: this ship (&#8220;Wooden-Bladed&#8221;) always had a fair wind, whenever the sail was set; it could be folded up at will and put in the pocket. <hi>Freyr</hi>: concerning him and his father, see <hi>Voluspo</hi>, 21, note, and <hi>Skirnismol</hi>, introductory prose and note.

Like stanza 43 an almost certain interpolation, it was probably drawn in by the reference to Skithblathnir in the stanza interpolated earlier. It is presumably in faulty condition. One Ms. has after the fifth line half of a sixth,&#8212;&#8220;Brimir of swords.&#8221; <hi>Yggdrasil</hi>: cf. stanzas 25&#8211;35. <hi>Skithblathnir</hi>: cf. stanza 43, note. <hi>Sleipnir</hi>: Othin&#8217;s eight-legged horse, one of Loki&#8217;s numerous progeny, borne by him to the stallion Svathilfari. This stallion belonged to the giant who built a fortress for the gods, and came so near to finishing it, with Svathilfari&#8217;s aid, as to make the gods fear he would win his promised reward&#8212;Freyja and the sun and moon. To delay the work, Loki turned himself into a mare, whereupon the stallion ran away, and the giant failed to complete his task within the stipulated time. <hi>Bilrost</hi>: probably another form of Bifrost (which Snorri has in his version of the stanza), on which cf. stanza 29. <hi>Bragi</hi>: the god of poetry. He is one of the later figures among the gods, and is mentioned only three times in the poems of the <hi>Edda</hi>. In Snorri&#8217;s <hi>Edda</hi>, however, he is of great importance. His wife is Ithun, goddess of youth. Perhaps the Norwegian skald Bragi Boddason, the oldest recorded skaldic poet, had been traditionally apotheosized as early as the tenth century. <hi>Hobrok</hi>: nothing further is known of him. <hi>Garm</hi>: cf. <hi>Voluspo</hi>, 44.

Lines and entire stanzas of this &#8220;catalogue&#8221; sort undoubtedly came and went with great freedom all through the period of oral transmission.

Snorri quotes the concluding stanza. In <hi>Regius</hi> the poem is entitled &#8220;For Scirnis&#8221; (&#8220;Skirnir&#8217;s Journey&#8221;).
</p><p>The <hi>Skirnismol</hi> differs sharply from the poems preceding it, in that it has a distinctly ballad quality. As a matter of fact, however, its verse is altogether dialogue, the narrative being supplied in the prose &#8220;links,&#8221; concerning which cf. introductory note to the <hi>Grimnismol</hi>. The dramatic effectiveness and vivid characterization of the poem seem to connect it with the <hi>Thrymskvitha</hi>, and the two may possibly have been put into their present form by the same man. Bugge&#8217;s guess that the <hi>Skirnismol</hi> was the work of the author of the <hi>Lokasenna</hi> is also possible, though it has less to support it.
</p><p>Critics have generally agreed in dating the poem as we now have it as early as the first half of the tenth century; Finnur Jonsson puts it as early as 900, and claims it, as usual, for Norway. Doubtless it was current in Norway, in one form or another, before the first Icelandic settlements, but his argument that the thistle (stanza 31) is not an Icelandic plant has little weight, for such curse-formulas must have traveled freely from place to place. In view of the evidence pointing to a western origin for many or all of the Eddic poems, Jonsson&#8217;s reiterated &#8220;<foreign lang="no" xml:lang="no">Digtet er sikkert norsk og ikke islandsk</foreign>&#8221; is somewhat exasperating. Wherever the <hi>Skirnismol</hi> was composed, it has been preserved in exceptionally good condition, and seems to be practically devoid of interpolations or lacun&#230;.</p></div2><div2 type="Section"><p id="p1.5.prose">Freyr, the son of Njorth, had sat one day in Hlithskjolf, and looked over all the worlds.

Snorri thus describes Njorth&#8217;s family: &#8220;Njorth begat two children in Noatun; the son was named Freyr, and the daughter Freyja; they were fair of aspect and mighty. Freyr is the noblest of the gods; he rules over rain and sunshine, and therewith the fruitfulness of the earth; it is well to call upon him for plenty and welfare, for he rules over wealth for mankind. Freyja is the noblest of the goddesses. When she rides to the fight, she has one-half of the slain, and Othin has half. When she goes on a journey, she drives her two cats, and sits in a cart. Love-songs please her well, and it is good to call on her in love-matters.&#8221; <hi>Hlithskjolf</hi>: Othin&#8217;s watch-tower; cf. <hi>Grimnismol</hi>, introductory prose. <hi>He said</hi>: both manuscripts have &#8220;Then Skathi said:&#8221; (Skathi was Njorth&#8217;s wife), but Bugge&#8217;s emendation, based on Snorri&#8217;s version, is doubtless correct.
</p><p id="n1.5.1"><ab type="parNum"><ref target="lg1.5.1">1</ref>.</ab> <hi>My son</hi>: both manuscripts, and many editors, have &#8220;our son,&#8221; which, of course, goes with the introduction of Skathi in the prose. As the stanza is clearly addressed to Skirnir, the change of pronouns seems justified. The same confusion occurs in stanza 2, where Skirnir in the manuscripts is made to speak of Freyr as <pb id="pb109a" n="109" facs="f:141"/>&#8220;your son&#8221; (plural). The plural pronoun in the original involves a metrical error, which is corrected by the emendation.
</p><p id="n1.5.4"><ab type="parNum"><ref target="lg1.5.4">4</ref>.</ab> <hi>Elfbeam</hi>: the sun, so called because its rays were fatal to elves and dwarfs; cf. <hi>Alvissmol</hi>, 35.
</p><p id="n1.5.6"><ab type="parNum"><ref target="lg1.5.6">6</ref>.</ab> <hi>Gymir</hi>: a mountain-giant, husband of Aurbotha, and father of Gerth, fairest among women. This is all Snorri tells of him in his paraphrase of the story.
</p><p id="n1.5.7"><ab type="parNum"><ref target="lg1.5.7">7</ref>.</ab> Snorri&#8217;s paraphrase of the poem is sufficiently close so that his addition of another sentence to Freyr&#8217;s speech makes it probable <pb id="pb110a" n="110" facs="f:142"/>that a stanza has dropped out between 7 and 8. This has been tentatively reconstructed, thus: &#8220;Hither to me &#160;&#160;|&#160;&#160; shalt thou bring the maid, / And home shalt thou lead her here, / If her father wills it &#160;&#160;|&#160;&#160; or wills it not, / And good reward shalt thou get.&#8221; Finn Magnusen detected the probable omission of a stanza here as early as 1821.
</p><p id="n1.5.8"><ab type="parNum"><ref target="lg1.5.8">8</ref>.</ab> <hi>The sword</hi>: Freyr&#8217;s gift of his sword to Skirnir eventually proves fatal, for at the last battle, when Freyr is attacked by Beli, whom he kills bare-handed, and later when the fire-demon, Surt, slays him in turn, he is weaponless; cf. <hi>Voluspo</hi>, 53 and note. <hi>Against the giants grim</hi>: the condition of this line makes it seem like an error in copying, and it is possible that it should be identical with the fourth line of the next stanza.

</p><p id="n1.5.15"><ab type="parNum"><ref target="lg1.5.15">15</ref>.</ab> No gap indicated in either manuscript. Bugge and Niedner have attempted emendations, while Hildebrand suggests that the last two lines of stanza 14 are spurious, 14, 1&#8211;2, and 15 thus forming a single stanza, which seems doubtful.
</p><p id="n1.5.16"><ab type="parNum"><ref target="lg1.5.16">16</ref>.</ab> <hi>Brother&#8217;s slayer</hi>: perhaps the brother is Beli, slain by Freyr; the only other references are in <hi>Voluspo</hi>, 53, and in Snorri&#8217;s paraphrase of the <hi>Skirnismol</hi>, which merely says that Freyr&#8217;s gift of his sword to Skirnir &#8220;was the reason why he was weaponless when he met Beli, and he killed him bare-handed.&#8221; Skirnir himself seems never to have killed anybody.

Baldr, however, sent the ring back to Othin from hell. How Freyr obtained it is nowhere stated.

</p><p>The poem differs sharply from those which precede it in the <hi lang="la" xml:lang="la">Codex Regius</hi>, both in metrical form and in spirit. It is, indeed, the most nearly formless of all the Eddic poems. The normal metre is the Malahattr (cf. Introduction, where an example is given). The name of this verse-form means &#8220;in the manner of conversation,&#8221; and the <hi>Harbarthsljoth&#8217;s</hi> verse fully justifies the term. The Atli poems exemplify the conventional use of Malahattr, but in the <hi>Harbarthsljoth</hi> the form is used with extraordinary freedom, and other metrical forms are frequently employed. A few of the speeches of which the poem is composed cannot be twisted into any known Old Norse metre, and appear to be simply prose.
</p><p>How far this confusion is due to interpolations and faulty transmission of the original poem is uncertain. Finnur Jonsson has attempted a wholesale purification of the poem, but his arbitrary condemnation of words, lines, and entire stanzas as spurious is quite unjustified by any positive evidence. I have accepted Mogk&#8217;s theory that the author was &#8220;a first-rate psychologist, but a poor poet,&#8221; and have translated the poem as it stands in the manuscripts. I have preserved the metrical confusion of the original by keeping throughout so far as possible to the metres found in the poem; if the rhythm of the translation is often hard to catch, the difficulty is no less with the original Norse.
</p><p>The poem is simply a contest of abuse, such as the early Norwegian and Icelander delighted in, the opposing figures being Thor and Othin, the latter appearing in the disguise of the ferryman Harbarth. Such billingsgate lent itself readily to changes, interpolations and omissions, and it is little wonder that the poem is chaotic. It consists mainly of boasting and of references, often luckily obscure, to disreputable events in the life of one or the other of the disputants. Some editors have sought to read a complex symbolism into it, particularly by representing <pb id="pb122" n="122" facs="f:154"/>it as a contest between the noble or warrior class (Othin) and the peasant (Thor). But it seems a pity to take such a vigorous piece of broad farce too seriously.
</p><p>Verse-form, substance, and certain linguistic peculiarities, notably the suffixed articles, point to a relatively late date (eleventh century) for the poem in its present form. Probably it had its origin in the early days, but its colloquial nature and its vulgarity made it readily susceptible to changes.
</p><p>Owing to the chaotic state of the text, and the fact that none of the editors or commentators have succeeded in improving it much, I have not in this case attempted to give all the important emendations and suggestions. The stanza-divisions are largely arbitrary.</p></div2><div2 type="Section"><p id="prose1.6">Thor was on his way back from a journey in the East, and came to a sound; on the other side of the sound was a ferryman with a boat.

In the race, which Hrungnir lost, he managed to dash uninvited into the home of the gods, where he became very drunk. Thor ejected him, and accepted his challenge to a duel. Hrungnir, terrified, had a helper made for him in the form of a dummy giant nine miles high and three miles broad. Hrungnir himself had a three-horned heart of stone and a head of stone; his shield was of stone and his weapon was a grindstone. But Thjalfi, Thor&#8217;s servant, told him the god would attack him out of the ground, wherefore Hrungnir laid down his shield and stood on it. The hammer Mjollnir shattered both the grindstone and Hrungnir&#8217;s <pb id="pb127a" n="127" facs="f:159"/>head, but part of the grindstone knocked Thor down, and the giant fell with his foot on Thor&#8217;s neck (cf. note on stanza 9).

He went in Freyja&#8217;s &#8220;hawk&#8217;s-dress&#8221; (cf. <hi>Thrymskvitha</hi>, 3), turned Ithun into a nut, and flew back with her. Thjazi, in the shape of an eagle, gave chase. But the gods kindled a fire which burnt the eagle&#8217;s wings, and then they killed him. Snorri&#8217;s prose version does not attribute this feat particularly to Thor.

</p><p id="n1.6.26"><ab type="parNum"><ref target="lg1.6.26">26</ref>.</ab> The reference here is to one of the most familiar episodes in Thor&#8217;s eastward journey. He and his companions came to a house in the forest, and went in to spend the night. Being disturbed by an earthquake and a terrific noise, they all crawled into a smaller room opening from the main one. In the morning, however, they discovered that the earthquake had been occasioned by the giant Skrymir&#8217;s lying down near them, and the noise by his snoring. The house in which they had taken refuge was his glove, the smaller room being the thumb. Skrymir was in fact Utgartha-Loki himself. That he is in this stanza called Fjalar (the name occurs also in <hi>Hovamol</hi>, 14) is probably due to a confusion of the names by which Utgartha-Loki went. Loki taunts Thor with this adventure in <hi>Lokasenna</hi>, 60 and 62, line 3 of this stanza being perhaps interpolated from <hi>Lokasenna</hi>, 60, 4.

Snorri does not quote it, although he tells the main story involved.
</p><p>The poem is a distinctly inferior piece of work, obviously based on various narrative fragments, awkwardly pieced together. Some critics, Jessen and Edzardi for instance, have maintained that the compiler had before him three distinct poems, which he simply put together; others, like Finnur Jonsson and Mogk, think that the author made a new poem of his own on the basis of earlier poems, now lost. It seems probable that he took a lot of odds and ends of material concerning Thor, whether in prose or in verse, and worked them together in a perfunctory way, without much caring how well they fitted. His chief aim was probably to impress the credulous imaginations of hearers greedy for wonders.
</p><p>The poem is almost certainly one of the latest of those dealing with the gods, though Finnur Jonsson, in order to support his theory of a Norwegian origin, has to date it relatively early. If, as seems probable, it was produced in Iceland, the chances are that it was composed in the first half of the eleventh century. Jessen, rather recklessly, goes so far as to put it two hundred years later. In any case, it belongs to a period of literary decadence,&#8212;the great days of Eddic poetry would never have permitted the nine hundred headed person found in Hymir&#8217;s home&#8212;and to one in which the usual forms of diction in mythological poetry had yielded somewhat to the verbal subtleties of skaldic verse.
</p><p>While the skaldic poetry properly falls outside the limits of this book, it is necessary here to say a word about it. There is preserved, in the sagas and elsewhere, a very considerable body of lyric poetry, the authorship of each poem being nearly always definitely stated, whether correctly or otherwise. This type of poetry is marked by an extraordinary complexity of diction, with a peculiarly difficult vocabulary of its own. It was to explain some of the &#8220;kennings&#8221; which composed this special <pb id="pb139" n="139" facs="f:171"/>vocabulary that Snorri wrote one of the sections of the <hi>Prose Edda</hi>. As an illustration, in a single stanza of one poem in the <hi>Egilssaga</hi>, a sword is called &#8220;the halo of the helm,&#8221; &#8220;the wound-hoe,&#8221; &#8220;the blood-snake&#8221; (possibly; no one is sure what the compound word means) and &#8220;the ice of the girdle,&#8221; while men appear in the same stanza as &#8220;Othin&#8217;s ash-trees,&#8221; and battle is spoken of as &#8220;the iron game.&#8221; One of the eight lines has defied translation completely.
</p><p>Skaldic diction made relatively few inroads into the earlier Eddic poems, but in the <hi>Hymiskvitha</hi> these circumlocutions are fairly numerous. This sets the poem somewhat apart from the rest of the mythological collection. Only the vigor of the two main stories&#8212;Thor&#8217;s expedition after Hymir&#8217;s kettle and the fishing trip in which he caught Mithgarthsorm&#8212;saves it from complete mediocrity.</p></div2><div2 type="Section"><lg id="lg1.7.1" type="Verse"><l><ab type="verseNum"><ref target="n1.7.1">1</ref>.</ab> Of old the gods &#160;&#160;|&#160;&#160; made feast together,

In either case, the gods were seeking information by magic as to where they could find plenty to drink. <hi>&#198;gir</hi>: a giant who is also the god of the sea; little is known of him outside of what is told here and in the introductory prose to the <hi>Lokasenna</hi>, though Snorri has a brief account of him, giving his home as Hlesey (L&#228;s&#246;, cf. <hi>Harbarthsljoth</hi>, 37). <hi>Grimnismol</hi>, 45, has a reference to this same feast.

It is not clear why Tyr, who is elsewhere spoken of as a son of Othin, should here call Hymir his father. Finnur Jonsson, in an attempt to get round this difficulty, deliberately changed the word &#8220;father&#8221; to &#8220;grandfather,&#8221; but this does not help greatly.
</p><p id="n1.7.6"><ab type="parNum"><ref target="lg1.7.6">6</ref>.</ab> Neither manuscript has any superscriptions, but most editors have supplied them as above. From this point through stanza 11 the editors have varied considerably in grouping the lines into stanzas. The manuscripts indicate the third lines of stanzas 7, 8, 9, and 10 as beginning stanzas, but this makes more complications than the present arrangement. It is possible that, as Sijmons suggests, two lines have been lost after stanza 6.
</p><p id="n1.7.7"><ab type="parNum"><ref target="lg1.7.7">7</ref>.</ab> <hi>Egil</hi>: possibly, though by no means certainly, the father of Thor&#8217;s servant, Thjalfi, for, according to Snorri, Thor&#8217;s first stop on this journey was at the house of a peasant whose children, Thjalfi and Roskva, he took into his service; cf. stanza 38, note. The <hi>Arnamagn&#230;an Codex</hi> has &#8220;&#198;gir&#8221; instead of &#8220;Egil,&#8221; but, aside from the fact that Thor had just left &#198;gir&#8217;s house, the sea-god can hardly have been spoken of as a goat-herd.

Several editors have sought to make a single word meaning &#8220;the famous enemy&#8221; out of the phrase. Concerning Thor as the friend of man, particularly of the peasant class, cf. introduction to <hi>Harbarthsljoth</hi>. <hi>Veur</hi>: another name, of uncertain meaning, for Thor.

</p><p id="n1.7.18"><ab type="parNum"><ref target="lg1.7.18">18</ref>.</ab> The manuscripts have no superscription. Many editors combine lines 3 and 4 with lines 1 and 2 of stanza 19. In Snorri&#8217;s extended paraphrase of the story, Hymir declines to go fishing with Thor on the ground that the latter is too small a person to be worth bothering about. &#8220;You would freeze,&#8221; he says, &#8220;if you stayed out in mid-ocean as long as I generally do.&#8221; <hi>Bait</hi> (line 4): the word literally means &#8220;chaff,&#8221; hence any small bits; Hymir means that Thor should collect dung for bait.
</p><p id="n1.7.19"><ab type="parNum"><ref target="lg1.7.19">19</ref>.</ab> Many editors combine lines 3 and 4 with stanza 20. <hi>Fortress</hi>, etc.: the ox&#8217;s head; cf. introductory note concerning the diction of this poem.

</p><p id="n1.7.25"><ab type="parNum"><ref target="lg1.7.25">25</ref>.</ab> No gap is indicated in the manuscripts, but that a line or more has been lost is highly probable. In Snorri&#8217;s version, Thor pulls so hard on the line that he drives both his feet through the flooring of the boat, and stands on bottom. When he pulls the serpent up, Hymir cuts the line with his bait-knife, which explains the serpent&#8217;s escape. Thor, in a rage, knocks Hymir overboard with his hammer, and then wades ashore.

Hymir&#8217;s mother is, however, the only many-headed giant actually to appear in the action of the poems, and it is safe to assume that the tradition as a whole belongs to the period of Norse folk-tales of the <hi lang="de" xml:lang="de">m&#228;rchen</hi> order.

</p><p id="n1.7.38"><ab type="parNum"><ref target="lg1.7.38">38</ref>.</ab> According to Snorri, when Thor set out with Loki (not Tyr) for the giants&#8217; land, he stopped first at a peasant&#8217;s house (cf. stanza 7 and note). There he proceeded to cook his own goats for supper. The peasant&#8217;s son, Thjalfi, eager to get at the marrow, split one of the leg-bones with his knife. The next morning, when Thor was ready to proceed with his journey, he called the goats to life again, but one of them proved irretrievably lame. His wrath led the peasant to give him both his children as <pb id="pb150a" n="150" facs="f:182"/>servants (cf. stanza 39). Snorri does not indicate that Loki was in any way to blame.

The introductory one links the poem closely to the <hi>Hymiskvitha</hi>, much as the <hi>Reginsmol</hi>, <hi>Fafnismol</hi> and <hi>Sigrdrifumol</hi> are linked together; the others fill in the narrative gaps in the dialogue&#8212;very like stage directions,&#8212;and provide a conclusion by relating Loki&#8217;s punishment, which, presumably, is here connected with the wrong incident. It is likely that often when the poem was recited during the two centuries or so before it was committed to writing, the speaker inserted some such explanatory comments, and the compiler of the collection followed this example by adding such explanations as he thought necessary. The <hi>Lokasenna</hi> is certainly much older than the <hi>Hymiskvitha</hi>, the connection between them being purely one of subject-matter; and the twelfth-century compiler evidently knew a good deal less about mythology than the author whose work he was annotating.</p></div2><div2 type="Section"><p id="prose1.8">&#198;gir, who was also called Gymir, had prepared ale for the gods, after he had got the mighty kettle, as now has been told. To this feast came Othin and Frigg, his wife. Thor came not, as he was on a journey in the East. Sif, <pb id="pb152" n="152" facs="f:184"/>Thor&#8217;s wife, was there, and Bragi with Ithun, his wife. Tyr, who had but one hand, was there; the wolf Fenrir had bitten off his other hand when they had bound him. There were Njorth and Skathi his wife, Freyr and Freyja, and Vithar, the son of Othin. Loki was there, and Freyr&#8217;s <pb id="pb153" n="153" facs="f:185"/>servants Byggvir and Beyla. Many were there of the gods and elves.
</p><p>&#198;gir had two serving-men, Fimafeng and Eldir. Glittering gold they had in place of firelight; the ale came in of itself; and great was the peace. The guests praised much the ability of &#198;gir&#8217;s serving-men. Loki might not endure that, and he slew Fimafeng. Then the gods shook their shields and howled at Loki and drove him away to the forest, and thereafter set to drinking again. Loki turned back, and outside he met Eldir. Loki spoke to him:

On &#198;gir cf. <hi>Grimnismol</hi>, 45, and <hi>Hymiskvitha</hi>, 1. <hi>Frigg</hi>: though Othin&#8217;s wife is often mentioned, she plays only a minor part in the Eddic poems; cf. <hi>Voluspo</hi>, 34, <hi>Vafthruthnismol</hi>, 1, and <hi>Grimnismol</hi>, introductory prose. <hi>Thor</hi>: the compiler is apparently a trifle confused as to Thor&#8217;s movements; the &#8220;journey in the East&#8221; here mentioned cannot be the one described in the <hi>Hymiskvitha</hi>, nor yet the one narrated by Snorri, as Loki was with Thor throughout that expedition. He probably means no more than that Thor was off killing giants. <hi>Sif</hi>: concerning Thor&#8217;s wife the chief incident is that Loki cut off her hair, and, at the command of the wrathful Thor, was compelled to have the dwarfs fashion her a new supply of hair out of gold; cf. <hi>Harbarthsljoth</hi>, 48. <hi>Bragi</hi>: the god of poetry; cf. <hi>Grimnismol</hi>, 44 and note. <hi>Ithun</hi>: the goddess of youth; cf. note on <hi>Skirnismol</hi>, 19. Ithun is not mentioned by name in any other of the Eddic poems, but Snorri tells in detail how the giant Thjazi stole her and her apples, explaining the reference in <hi>Harbarthsljoth</hi>, 19 (q. v.). <hi>Tyr</hi>: the god of battle; cf. <hi>Hymiskvitha</hi>, 4, and (concerning his dealings with the wolf Fenrir) <hi>Voluspo</hi>, 39, note. <hi>Njorth</hi>: the chief of the Wanes, and father of <hi>Freyr</hi> and <hi>Freyja</hi>; cf. (concerning the whole family) <hi>Skirnismol</hi>, introductory prose and note, also <hi>Voluspo</hi>, 21 and note. <hi>Skathi</hi>: Njorth&#8217;s wife was the daughter of the giant Thjazi; cf. <hi>Harbarthsljoth</hi>, 19, note, and <hi>Grimnismol</hi>, 11. <hi>Vithar</hi>: the silent god, the son of Othin who avenged his father by slaying the wolf Fenrir; cf. <hi>Voluspo</hi>, 54, <hi>Vafthruthnismol</hi>, 51, and <hi>Grimnismol</hi>, 17. <hi>Loki</hi>: the mischief-making fire-god; in addition to the many references to his career in the <hi>Lokasenna</hi>, cf. particularly <hi>Voluspo</hi>, 32 and 35, and notes. <hi>Byggvir</hi> and <hi>Beyla</hi>: not mentioned elsewhere in the poems; Freyr&#8217;s conspicuous servant is Skirnir, hero of the <hi>Skirnismol</hi>. <hi>Fimafeng</hi> (&#8220;The Swift Handler&#8221;) <pb id="pb153a" n="153" facs="f:185"/>and <hi>Eldir</hi> (&#8220;The Man of the Fire&#8221;): mentioned only in connection with this incident. <hi>Glittering gold</hi>: &#198;gir&#8217;s use of gold to light his hall, which was often thought of as under the sea, was responsible for the phrase &#8220;flame of the flood,&#8221; and sundry kindred phrases, meaning &#8220;gold.&#8221;

</p><p id="n1.8.7"><ab type="parNum"><ref target="lg1.8.7">7</ref>.</ab> In the manuscript this stanza begins with a small letter, and Heinzel unites it with stanza 6.

Why Loki taunts him with cowardice (stanzas 11&#8211;13&#8211;15) is not clear, for poetry, of which Bragi was the patron, was generally associated in the Norse mind with peculiar valor, and most of the skaldic poets were likewise noted fighters.
</p><p id="n1.8.9"><ab type="parNum"><ref target="lg1.8.9">9</ref>.</ab> There exists no account of any incident in which Othin and Loki thus swore blood-brotherhood, but they were so often allied in enterprises that the idea is wholly reasonable. The common process of &#8220;mingling blood&#8221; was carried out quite literally, and the promise of which Loki speaks is characteristic of those which, in the sagas, often accompanied the ceremony; cf. <hi>Brot af Sigurtharkvithu</hi>, 18 and note.
</p><p id="n1.8.10"><ab type="parNum"><ref target="lg1.8.10">10</ref>.</ab> In stanzas 10&#8211;31 the manuscript has nothing to indicate the identity of the several speakers, but these are uniformly clear <pb id="pb156a" n="156" facs="f:188"/>enough through the context. <hi>Vithar</hi>: cf. note on introductory prose. <hi>The wolf&#8217;s father</hi>: Loki; cf. <hi>Voluspo</hi>, 39 and note.
</p><p id="n1.8.13"><ab type="parNum"><ref target="lg1.8.13">13</ref>.</ab> Sijmons makes one line of lines 4&#8211;5 by cutting out a part of each; Finnur Jonsson rejects 5 as spurious.

</p><p id="n1.8.15"><ab type="parNum"><ref target="lg1.8.15">15</ref>.</ab> <hi>Adorner of benches</hi>: this epithet presumably implies that Bragi is not only slothful, but also effeminate, for a very similar word, &#8220;pride of the benches,&#8221; means a bride.
</p><p id="n1.8.16"><ab type="parNum"><ref target="lg1.8.16">16</ref>.</ab> <hi>Ithun</hi>: Bragi&#8217;s wife; cf. note on introductory prose. The goddesses who, finding that their husbands are getting the worst of it, take up the cudgels with Loki, all find themselves confronted with undeniable facts in their own careers; cf. stanzas 26 (Frigg), 52 (Skathi) and 54 (Sif). Gefjun and Freyja are silenced in similar fashion. <hi>Wish-son</hi>: adopted son; Loki was the son of the giant Farbauti and the giantess Laufey, and hence was not of the race of the gods, but had been virtually adopted by Othin, who subsequently had good reason to regret it.

Certainly Othin&#8217;s <pb id="pb159a" n="159" facs="f:191"/>answer (stanza 21, lines 3&#8211;4) fits Frigg perfectly, for she shared his knowledge of the future, whereas it has no relation to anything known of Gefjun.

</p><p>Artistically the <hi>Thrymskvitha</hi> is one of the best, as it is, next to the <hi>Voluspo</hi>, the most famous, of the entire collection. It has, indeed, been called &#8220;the finest ballad in the world,&#8221; and not without some reason. Its swift, vigorous action, the sharpness of its characterization and the humor of the central situation combine to make it one of the most vivid short narrative poems ever composed. Of course we know nothing specific of its author, but there can be no question that he was a poet of extraordinary ability. The poem assumed its present form, most critics agree, somewhere about 900, and thus it is one of the oldest in the collection. It has been suggested, on the basis of stylistic similarity, that its author may also have composed the <hi>Skirnismol</hi>, and possibly <hi>Baldrs Draumar</hi>. There is also some resemblance between the <hi>Thrymskvitha</hi> and the <hi>Lokasenna</hi> (note, in this connection, Bugge&#8217;s suggestion that the <hi>Skirnismol</hi> and the <hi>Lokasenna</hi> may have been by the same man), and it is not impossible that all four poems have a single authorship.
</p><p>The <hi>Thrymskvitha</hi> has been preserved in excellent condition, without any serious gaps or interpolations. In striking contrast to many of the poems, it contains no prose narrative links, the story being told in narrative verse&#8212;a rare phenomenon in the poems of the <hi>Edda</hi>.</p></div2><div2 type="Section"><lg id="lg1.9.1" type="Verse"><l><ab type="verseNum"><ref target="n1.9.1">1</ref>.</ab> Wild was Vingthor &#160;&#160;|&#160;&#160; when he awoke,

That all his answers are quite satisfactory makes no difference whatever to the outcome. The questions and answers differ radically from those of the <hi>Vafthruthnismol</hi>. Instead of being essentially mythological, they all concern synonyms. Thor asks what the earth, the sky, the moon, and so on, are called &#8220;in each of all the worlds,&#8221; but there is no apparent significance in the fact that the gods call the earth one thing and the giants call it another; the answers are simply strings of poetic circumlocutions, or &#8220;kennings.&#8221; Concerning the use of these &#8220;kennings&#8221; in skaldic poetry, cf. introductory note to the <hi>Hymiskvitha</hi>.
</p><p>Mogk is presumably right in dating the poem as late as the twelfth century, assigning it to the period of &#8220;the Icelandic renaissance of skaldic poetry.&#8221; It appears to have been the work of a man skilled in poetic construction,&#8212;Thor&#8217;s questions, for instance, are neatly balanced in pairs,&#8212;and fully familiar with the intricacies of skaldic diction, but distinctly weak in his mythology. In other words, it is learned rather than spontaneous poetry. Finnur Jonsson&#8217;s attempt to make it a tenth century Norwegian poem baffles logic. Vigfusson is pretty sure the poem shows marked traces of Celtic influence, which is by no means incompatible with Mogk&#8217;s theory (cf. introductory note to the <hi>Rigsthula</hi>).
</p><p>The poem is found only in <hi>Regius</hi>, where it follows the <hi>Thrymskvitha</hi>. Snorri quotes stanzas 20 and 30, the manuscripts of the <hi>Prose Edda</hi> giving the name of the poem as <hi>Alvissmol</hi>, <hi>Alsvinnsmol</hi> or <hi>Olvismol</hi>. It is apparently in excellent condition, without serious errors of transmission, although interpolations or omissions in such a poem might have been made so easily as to defy detection.
</p><p>The translation of the many synonyms presents, of course, <pb id="pb184" n="184" facs="f:216"/>unusual difficulties, particularly as many of the Norse words can be properly rendered in English only by more or less extended phrases. I have kept to the original meanings as closely as I could without utterly destroying the metrical structure.</p></div2><div2 type="Section"><p><hi>Alvis spake</hi>:

Many editors follow this stanza with one spoken by Alvis, found in late paper manuscripts, as follows: &#8220;Ask then, Vingthor, &#160;&#160;|&#160;&#160; since eager thou art / The lore of the dwarf to learn; / Oft have I fared &#160;&#160;|&#160;&#160; in the nine worlds all, / And wide is my wisdom of each.&#8221;

Men (dwellers in Mithgarth) appear in each of Alvis&#8217;s thirteen answers; so do the gods (Asgarth) and the giants (Jotunheim). The elves (Alfheim) appear in eleven <pb id="pb187a" n="187" facs="f:219"/>answers, the Wanes (Vanaheim) in nine, and the dwarfs (who occupied no special world, unless one identifies them with the dark elves of Svartalfaheim) in seven. The dwellers &#8220;in hell&#8221; appear in six stanzas; the phrase probably refers to the world of the dead, though Mogk thinks it may mean the dwarfs. In stanzas where the gods are already listed appear names elsewhere applied only to them,&#8212;&#8220;holy ones,&#8221; &#8220;sons of the gods&#8221; and &#8220;high ones,&#8221;&#8212;as if these names meant beings of a separate race. &#8220;Men&#8221; appears twice in the same stanza, and so do the giants, if one assumes that they are &#8220;the sons of Suttung.&#8221; Altogether it is useless to pay much attention to the mythology of Alvis&#8217;s replies.

The <pb id="pb189a" n="189" facs="f:221"/>sun &#8220;deceives&#8221; him because, like the other dwarfs living underground, he cannot live in its light, and always fears lest sunrise may catch him unaware. The sun&#8217;s rays have power to turn the dwarfs into stone, and the giantess Hrimgerth meets a similar fate (cf. <hi>Helgakvitha Hjorvarthssonar</hi>, 30). Alvis suffers in the same way; cf. stanza 35.

It is preserved in various late paper manuscripts, with the title <hi>Vegtamskvitha</hi> (The Lay of Vegtam), which has been used by some editors.
</p><p>The poem, which contains but fourteen stanzas, has apparently been preserved in excellent condition. Its subject-matter and style link it closely with the <hi>Voluspo</hi>. Four of the five lines of stanza 11 appear, almost without change, in the <hi>Voluspo</hi>, 32&#8211;33, and the entire poem is simply an elaboration of the episode outlined in those and the preceding stanzas. It has been suggested that <hi>Baldrs Draumar</hi> and the <hi>Voluspo</hi> may have been by the same author. There is also enough similarity in style between <hi>Baldrs Draumar</hi> and the <hi>Thrymskvitha</hi> (note especially the opening stanza) to give color to Vigfusson&#8217;s guess that these two poems had a common authorship. In any case, <hi>Baldrs Draumar</hi> presumably assumed its present form not later than the first half of the tenth century.
</p><p>Whether the Volva (wise-woman) of the poem is identical with the speaker in the <hi>Voluspo</hi> is purely a matter for conjecture. Nothing definitely opposes such a supposition. As in the longer poem she foretells the fall of the gods, so in this case she prophesies the first incident of that fall, the death of Baldr. Here she is called up from the dead by Othin, anxious to know the meaning of Baldr&#8217;s evil dreams; in the <hi>Voluspo</hi> it is likewise intimated that the Volva has risen from the grave.
</p><p>The poem, like most of the others in the collection, is essentially dramatic rather than narrative, summarizing a story which was doubtless familiar to every one who heard the poem recited.</p></div2><div2 type="Section"><lg id="lg1.11.1" type="Verse"><l><ab type="verseNum"><ref target="n1.11.1">1</ref>.</ab> Once were the gods &#160;&#160;|&#160;&#160; together met,

In this instance he has unusual need to do so, for as the wise-woman belongs apparently to the race of the giants, she would be unwilling to answer a god&#8217;s questions. <hi>Heaven</hi>: the word used includes all the upper worlds, in contrast to hell. <hi>Benches</hi>, etc.: the adornment of the benches and raised platforms, or elevated parts of the house, was a regular part of the preparation for a feast of welcome. The text of the two last lines is somewhat uncertain.

The only manuscript containing it is the so-called <hi lang="la" xml:lang="la">Codex Wormanius</hi>, a manuscript of Snorri&#8217;s <hi>Prose Edda</hi>. The poem appears on the last sheet of this manuscript, which unluckily is incomplete, and thus the end of the poem is lacking. In the <hi lang="la" xml:lang="la">Codex Wormanius</hi> itself the poem has no title, but a fragmentary parchment included with it calls the poem the <hi>Rigsthula</hi>. Some late paper manuscripts give it the title of <hi>Rigsmol</hi>.
</p><p>The <hi>Rigsthula</hi> is essentially unlike anything else which editors have agreed to include in the so-called <hi>Edda</hi>. It is a definitely cultural poem, explaining, on a mythological basis, the origin of the different castes of early society: the thralls, the peasants, and the warriors. From the warriors, finally, springs one who is destined to become a king, and thus the whole poem is a song in praise of the royal estate. This fact in itself would suffice to indicate that the <hi>Rigsthula</hi> was not composed in Iceland, where for centuries kings were regarded with profound disapproval.
</p><p>Not only does the <hi>Rigsthula</hi> praise royalty, but it has many of the earmarks of a poem composed in praise of a particular king. The manuscript breaks off at a most exasperating point, just as the connection between the mythical &#8220;Young Kon&#8221; (Konr ungr, konungr, &#8220;king&#8221;; but cf. stanza 44, note) and the monarch in question is about to be established. Owing to the character of the Norse settlements in Iceland, Ireland, and the western islands generally, search for a specific king leads back to either Norway or Denmark; despite the arguments advanced by Edzardi, Vigfusson, Powell, and others, it seems most improbable that such a poem should have been produced elsewhere than on the Continent, the region where Scandinavian royalty most flourished. Finnur Jonsson&#8217;s claim for Norway, with Harald the Fair-Haired as the probable king in question, is much less impressive than Mogk&#8217;s ingenious demonstration that the poem was in all probability composed in Denmark, in honor of either Gorm the Old or Harald Blue-Tooth. His proof is based chiefly on the evidence provided by stanza 49, and is summarized in the note to that stanza.
<pb id="pb202" n="202" facs="f:234"/></p><p>The poet, however, was certainly not a Dane, but probably a wandering Norse singer, who may have had a dozen homes, and who clearly had spent much time in some part of the western island world chiefly inhabited by Celts. The extent of Celtic influence on the Eddic poems in general is a matter of sharp dispute. Powell, for example, claims almost all the poems for the &#8220;Western Isles,&#8221; and attributes nearly all their good qualities to Celtic influence. Without here attempting to enter into the details of the argument, it may be said that the weight of authoritative opinion, while clearly recognizing the marks of Celtic influence in the poems, is against this view; contact between the roving Norsemen of Norway and Iceland and the Celts of Ireland and the &#8220;Western Isles,&#8221; and particularly the Orkneys, was so extensive as to make the presumption of an actual Celtic home for the poems seem quite unnecessary.
</p><p>In the case of the <hi>Rigsthula</hi> the poet unquestionably had not only picked up bits of the Celtic speech (the name Rig itself is almost certainly of Celtic origin, and there are various other Celtic words employed), but also had caught something of the Celtic literary spirit. This explains the cultural nature of the poem, quite foreign to Norse poetry in general. On the other hand, the style as a whole is vigorously Norse, and thus the explanation that the poem was composed by an itinerant Norse poet who had lived for some time in the Celtic islands, and who was on a visit to the court of a Danish king, fits the ascertainable facts exceedingly well. As Christianity was introduced into Denmark around 960, the <hi>Rigsthula</hi> is not likely to have been composed much after that date, and probably belongs to the first half of the tenth century. Gorm the Old died about the year 935, and was succeeded by Harald Blue-Tooth, who died about 985.
</p><p>The fourteenth (or late thirteenth) century annotator identifies Rig with Heimdall, but there is nothing in the poem itself, and very little anywhere else, to warrant this, and it seems likely that the poet had Othin, and not Heimdall, in mind, his purpose being to trace the origin of the royal estate to the chief of the gods. The evidence bearing on this identification is briefly summed up in the note on the introductory prose passage, but the question involves complex and baffling problems in mythology, and from very early times the status of Heimdall was unquestionably confusing to the Norse mind.</p></div2><div2 type="Section"><pb id="pb203" n="203" facs="f:235"/><p id="prose1.12">They tell in old stories that one of the gods, whose name was Heimdall, went on his way along a certain seashore, and came to a dwelling, where he called himself Rig.

Was he familiar with the tradition in forms other than that of the poem? If so, his introductory note was scanty, for, outside of identifying <hi>Rig</hi> as <hi>Heimdall</hi>, he provides no information not found in the poem. Probably he meant simply to refer to the poem itself as a relic of antiquity, and the identification of Rig as Heimdall may well have been an attempt at constructive criticism of his own. The note was presumably written somewhere about 1300, or even later, and there is no reason for crediting the annotator with any considerable knowledge of mythology. There is little to favor the identification of Rig with Heimdall, the watchman of the gods, beyond a few rather vague passages in the other poems. Thus in <hi>Voluspo</hi>, 1, the Volva asks hearing &#8220;from Heimdall&#8217;s sons both high and low&#8221;; in <hi>Grimnismol</hi>, 13, there is a very doubtful line which may mean that Heimdall &#8220;o&#8217;er men holds sway, it is said,&#8221; and in &#8220;the Short Voluspo&#8221; (<hi>Hyndluljoth</hi>, 40) he is called &#8220;the kinsman of men.&#8221; On the other hand, everything in the <hi>Rigsthula</hi>, including the phrase &#8220;the aged and wise&#8221; in stanza 1, and the references to runes in stanzas 36, 44, and 46, fits Othin exceedingly well. It seems probable that the annotator was wrong, and that Rig is Othin, and not Heimdall. <hi>Rig</hi>: almost certainly based on the Old Irish word for &#8220;king,&#8221; &#8220;ri&#8221; or &#8220;rig.&#8221;

The exact significance of Rig&#8217;s giving his own name to Jarl (cf. stanza 46), and thus recognizing him, potentially at least, as a king, depends on the conditions under <pb id="pb213a" n="213" facs="f:245"/>which the poem was composed (cf.

According to the Latin epitome of the <hi>Skj&#246;ldungasaga</hi> by Arngrimur Jonsson, &#8220;Rig (Rigus) was a man not the least among the great ones of his time. He married the daughter of a certain Danp, lord of Danpsted, whose name was Dana; and later, having won the royal title for his province, left as his heir his son by Dana, called Dan or Danum, all of whose subjects were called Danes.&#8221; This may or may not be conclusive, and it is a great pity that the manuscript breaks off abruptly at this stanza.

The lateness of this manuscript would of itself be enough to cast a doubt upon the condition in which the poem has been preserved, and there can be no question that what we have of it is in very poor shape. It is, in fact, two separate poems, or parts of them, clumsily put together. The longer one, the <hi>Poem of Hyndla</hi> proper, is chiefly a collection of names, not strictly mythological but belonging to the semi-historical hero-sagas of Norse tradition. The wise-woman, Hyndla, being asked by Freyja to trace the ancestry of her favorite, Ottar, for the purpose of deciding a wager, gives a complex genealogy including many of the heroes who appear in the popular sagas handed down from days long before the Icelandic settlements. The poet was learned, but without enthusiasm; it is not likely that he composed the <hi>Hyndluljoth</hi> much before the twelfth century, though the material of which it is compounded must have been very much older. Although the genealogies are essentially continental, the poem seems rather like a product of the arch&#230;ological period of Iceland.
</p><p>Inserted bodily in the <hi>Hyndluljoth</hi> proper is a fragment of fifty-one lines, taken from a poem of which, by a curious chance, we know the name. Snorri quotes one stanza of it, calling it &#8220;the short <hi>Voluspo</hi>.&#8221; The fragment preserved gives, of course, no indication of the length of the original poem, but it shows that it was a late and very inferior imitation of the great <hi>Voluspo</hi>. Like the <hi>Hyndluljoth</hi> proper, it apparently comes from the twelfth century; but there is nothing whatever to indicate that the two poems were the work of the same man, or were ever connected in any way until some blundering copyist mixed them up. Certainly the connection did not exist in the middle of the thirteenth century, when Snorri quoted &#8220;the short <hi>Voluspo</hi>.&#8221;
</p><p>Neither poem is of any great value, either as mythology or as poetry. The author of &#8220;the short <hi>Voluspo</hi>&#8221; seems, indeed, to have been more or less confused as to his facts; and both poets were <pb id="pb218" n="218" facs="f:250"/>too late to feel anything of the enthusiasm of the earlier school. The names of Hyndla&#8217;s heroes, of course, suggest an unlimited number of stories, but as most of these have no direct relation to the poems of the <hi>Edda</hi>, I have limited the notes to a mere record of who the persons mentioned were, and the saga-groups in which they appeared.</p></div2><div2 type="Section"><p><hi>Freyja spake</hi>:

As stanzas 9&#8211;10 show, Ottar has made a wager of his entire inheritance with Angantyr regarding the relative loftiness of their ancestry, and by rich offerings (Hyndla hints at less commendable methods) has induced Freyja to assist him in establishing his genealogy. Freyja, having turned Ottar for purposes of disguise into a boar, calls on the giantess <hi>Hyndla</hi> (&#8220;She-Dog&#8221;) to aid her. Hyndla does not appear elsewhere in the poems.

Saxo Grammaticus tells of the battle between them and Hjalmar and Orvar-Odd. Line 1 does not appear in the manuscript, but is added from the list of names given in the sagas. The Berserkers were wild warriors, distinguished above all by the fits of frenzy to which they were subject in battle; during these fits they howled like wild beasts, foamed at the mouth, and gnawed the iron rims of their shields. At such times they were proof against steel or fire, but when the fever abated they were weak.

According to Norse tradition, in which Jormunrek played a large part, he slew his own sons (cf. <hi>Guthrunarhvot</hi> and <hi>Hamthesmol</hi>). In the saga Jormunrek married Sigurth&#8217;s daughter, Svanhild. Stanzas 25&#8211;27 connect Ottar&#8217;s descent with the whole Volsung-Sigurth-Jormunrek-Gjuki genealogy.

Everything points to a relatively late origin for the poems: their extensive use of &#8220;kennings&#8221; or poetical circumlocutions, their romantic spirit, quite foreign to the character of the unquestionably older poems, the absence of any reference to them in the earlier documents, the frequent errors in mythology, and, finally, the fact that the poems appear to have been preserved in unusually good condition. Whether or not a connecting link of narrative verse joining the two parts has been lost is an open question; on the whole it seems likely that the story was sufficiently well known so that the reciter of the poem (or poems) merely filled in the gap with a brief prose summary in pretty much his own words. The general relationship between dialogue and narrative in the Eddic poems is discussed in the introductory note to the <hi>Grimnismol</hi>, in connection with the use of prose links.
</p><p>The love story of Svipdag and Mengloth is not referred to elsewhere in the <hi>Poetic Edda</hi>, nor does Snorri mention it; however, Groa, who here appears as Svipdag&#8217;s mother, is spoken of by Snorri as a wise woman, the wife of Orvandil, who helps Thor with her magic charms. On the other hand, the essence of the story, the hero&#8217;s winning of a bride ringed about by flames, is strongly suggestive of parts of the Sigurth-Brynhild traditions. Whether or not it is to be regarded as a nature or solar myth depends entirely on one&#8217;s view of the whole &#8220;solar myth&#8221; school of criticism, not so highly esteemed today as formerly; such an interpretation is certainly not necessary to explain what is, under any circumstances, a very charming romance told, in the main, with dramatic effectiveness.
</p><p>In later years the story of Svipdag and Mengloth became popular throughout the North, and was made the subject of many Danish and Swedish as well as Norwegian ballads. These have greatly assisted in the reconstruction of the outlines of the narrative surrounding the dialogue poems here given.</p></div2><div2 type="Section"><pb id="pb235" n="235" facs="f:267"/><p>I.

Rind was the giantess who became the mother of Vali, Othin&#8217;s son, the one-night-old avenger of Baldr (cf. <hi>Voluspo</hi>, 33&#8211;34, and <hi>Baldrs Draumar</hi>, 11 and note).

</p><p id="n1.14.10"><ab type="parNum"><ref target="lg1.14.10">10</ref>.</ab> This stanza is a close parallel to <hi>Hovamol</hi>, 150, and the fifth line may well be an interpolation from line 4 of that stanza.

A dead woman&#8217;s curse would naturally be more potent, whether she was Christian or otherwise, than a living one&#8217;s. Presumably this charm is much older than the poem in which it here stands.
</p><p id="n1.14.16"><ab type="parNum"><ref target="lg1.14.16">16</ref>.</ab> At this point Groa&#8217;s song ends, and Svipdag, thus fortified, goes to seek Mengloth. All the link that is needed between the poems is approximately this: &#8220;Then Svipdag searched long for <pb id="pb239a" n="239" facs="f:271"/>Mengloth, and at last he came to a great house set all about with flames. And before the house there was a giant.&#8221;
</p><p id="n1.14.17"><ab type="parNum"><ref target="lg1.14.17">17</ref>.</ab> Most editors have here begun a new series of stanza numbers, but if the <hi>Grougaldr</hi> and the <hi>Fjolsvinnsmol</hi> are to be considered as a single poem, it seems more reasonable to continue the stanza numbers consecutively. Bugge thinks a stanza has been lost before 17, including Fjolsvith&#8217;s name, so that the &#8220;he&#8221; in line 1 might have something to refer to. However, just such a prose link as I have suggested in the note on stanza 16 would serve the purpose. Editors have suggested various rearrangements in the lines of stanzas 17&#8211;19. The substance, however, is clear enough. The giant <hi>Fjolsvith</hi> (&#8220;Much-Wise&#8221;), the warder of the house in which Mengloth dwells, sees Svipdag coming and stops him with the customary threats. The assignment of the <pb id="pb240a" n="240" facs="f:272"/>speeches in stanzas 17&#8211;20, in the absence of any indications in the manuscripts, is more or less guesswork.

It was also included in the <hi>Arnamagn&#230;an Codex</hi>, but unluckily it begins at the very end of the fragment which has been preserved, and thus only a few lines of the opening prose remain. This is doubly regrettable because the text in <hi>Regius</hi> is unquestionably in very bad shape, and the other manuscript would doubtless have been of great assistance in the reconstruction of the poem.
</p><p>There has been a vast amount written regarding the Weland tradition as a whole, discussing particularly the relations between the <hi>V&#246;lundarkvitha</hi> and the Weland passage in <hi>Deor&#8217;s Lament</hi>. There can be little question that the story came to the North from Saxon regions, along with many of the other early hero tales. In stanza 16 the Rhine is specifically mentioned as the home of treasure; and the presence of the story in Anglo-Saxon poetry probably as early as the first part of the eighth century proves beyond a doubt that the legend cannot have been a native product of Scandinavia. In one form or another, however, the legend or the smith persisted for centuries throughout all the Teutonic lands, and the name of Wayland Smith is familiar to all readers of Walter Scott, and even of Rudyard Kipling&#8217;s tales of England.
</p><p>In what form this story reached the North is uncertain. Sundry striking parallels between the diction of the <hi>V&#246;lundarkvitha</hi> and that of the Weland passage in <hi>Deor&#8217;s Lament</hi> make it distinctly probable that a Saxon song on this subject had found its way to Scandinavia or Iceland. But the prose introduction to the poem mentions the &#8220;old sagas&#8221; in which V&#246;lund was celebrated, and in the <hi>Thithrekssaga</hi> we have definite evidence of the existence of such prose narrative in the form of the <hi>Velentssaga</hi> (Velent, V&#246;lund, Weland, and Wayland all being, of course, identical), which gives a long story for which the <hi>V&#246;lundarkvitha</hi> can have supplied relatively little, if any, of the material. It is probable, then, that Weland stories were current in both prose and verse in Scandinavia as early as the latter part of the ninth century.
<pb id="pb253" n="253" facs="f:287"/></p><p>Once let a figure become popular in oral tradition, and the number and variety of the incidents connected with his name will increase very rapidly. Doubtless there were scores of Weland stories current in the eighth, ninth, and tenth centuries, many of them with very little if any traditional authority. The main one, however, the story of the laming of the smith by King Nithuth (or by some other enemy) and of Weland&#8217;s terrible revenge, forms the basis of the <hi>V&#246;lundarkvitha</hi>. To this, by way of introduction, has been added the story of V&#246;lund and the swan-maiden, who, to make things even more complex, is likewise said to be a Valkyrie. Some critics maintain that these two sections were originally two distinct poems, merely strung together by the compiler with the help of narrative prose links; but the poem as a whole has a kind of dramatic unity which suggests rather that an early poet&#8212;for linguistically the poem belongs among the oldest of the Eddic collection&#8212;used two distinct legends, whether in prose or verse, as the basis for the composition of a new and homogeneous poem.
</p><p>The swan-maiden story appears, of course, in many places quite distinct from the Weland tradition, and, in another form, became one of the most popular of German <corr sic="folk tales">folk-tales</corr>. Like the story of Weland, however, it is of German rather than Scandinavian origin, and the identification of the swan-maidens as Valkyries, which may have taken place before the legend reached the North, may, on the other hand, have been simply an attempt to connect southern tradition with figures well known in northern mythology.
</p><p>The <hi>V&#246;lundarkvitha</hi> is full of prose narrative links, including an introduction. The nature of such prose links has already been discussed in the introductory note to the <hi>Grimnismol</hi>; the <hi>V&#246;lundarkvitha</hi> is a striking illustration of the way in which the function of the earlier Eddic verse was limited chiefly to dialogue or description, the narrative outline being provided, if at all, in prose. This prose was put in by each reciter according to his fancy and knowledge, and his estimate of his hearers&#8217; need for such explanations; some of it, as in this instance, eventually found its way into the written record.
</p><p>The manuscript of the <hi>V&#246;lundarkvitha</hi> is in such bad shape, and the conjectural emendations have been so numerous, that in the notes I have attempted to record only the most important of them.</p></div2><div2 type="Section"><pb id="pb254" n="254" facs="f:288"/><p id="prose2.1">There was a king in Sweden named Nithuth. He had two sons and one daughter; her name was Bothvild. There were three brothers, sons of a king of the Finns: one was called Slagfith, another Egil, the third V&#246;lund. They went on snowshoes and hunted wild beasts. They came into Ulfdalir and there they built themselves a house; there was a lake there which is called Ulfsjar. Early one morning they found on the shore of the lake three women, who were spinning flax. Near them were their swan-garments, for they were Valkyries. Two of them were daughters of King Hlothver, Hlathguth the Swan-White and Hervor the All-Wise, and the third was Olrun, daughter of Kjar from Valland. These did they bring <pb id="pb255" n="255" facs="f:289"/>home to their hall with them. Egil took Olrun, and Slagfith Swan-White, and V&#246;lund All-Wise. There they dwelt seven winters; but then they flew away to find battles, and came back no more. Then Egil set forth on his snowshoes to follow Olrun, and Slagfith followed Swan-White, but V&#246;lund stayed in Ulfdalir. He was a most skillful man, as men know from old tales. King Nithuth had him taken by force, as the poem here tells.

In any case, the scene of the story has moved from Saxon lands into the Northeast. The first and last sentences of the introduction refer to the second part of the poem; the rest of it concerns the swan-maidens episode. <hi>Bothvild</hi> (&#8220;Warlike Maid&#8221;): V&#246;lund&#8217;s victim in the latter part of the poem. <hi>King of the Finns</hi>: this notion, clearly later than the poem, which calls V&#246;lund an elf, may perhaps be ascribed to the annotator who composed the prose introduction. The Finns, meaning the dwellers in Lapland, were generally credited with magic powers. <hi>Egil</hi> appears in the <hi>Thithrekssaga</hi> as V&#246;lund&#8217;s brother, but <hi>Slagfith</hi> is not elsewhere mentioned. <hi>Ulfdalir</hi> (&#8220;Wolf-Dale&#8221;), <hi>Ulfsjar</hi> (&#8220;Wolf-Sea&#8221;), <hi>Valland</hi> (&#8220;Slaughter-Land&#8221;): mythical places without historical identification. <hi>Valkyries</hi>: cf. <hi>Voluspo</hi>, 31 and note; there is nothing in the poem to identify the three swan-maidens as Valkyries except one obscure word in line 2 of stanza 1 and again in line 5 of stanza 5, which may mean, as Gering translates it, &#8220;helmed,&#8221; or else &#8220;fair and wise.&#8221; I suspect that the annotator, anxious to give the Saxon legend as much northern local color as possible, was mistaken in his mythology, and that <pb id="pb255a" n="255" facs="f:289"/>the poet never conceived of his swan-maidens as Valkyries at all. However, this identification of swan-maidens with Valkyries was not uncommon; cf. <hi>Helreith Brynhildar</hi>, 7. The three maidens&#8217; names, <hi>Hlathguth</hi>, <hi>Hervor</hi>, and <hi>Olrun</hi>, do not appear in the lists of Valkyries. <hi>King Hlothver</hi>: this name suggests the southern origin of the story, as it is the northern form of Ludwig; the name appears again in <hi>Guthrunarkvitha</hi> II, 26, and that of <hi>Kjar</hi> is found in <hi>Atlakvitha</hi>, 7, both of these poems being based on German stories. It is worth noting that the composer of this introductory note seems to have had little or no information beyond what was actually contained in the poem as it has come down to us; he refers to the &#8220;old stories&#8221; about V&#246;lund, but either he was unfamiliar with them in detail or else he thought it needless to make use of them. His note simply puts in clear and connected form what the verse tells somewhat obscurely; his only additions are making Nithuth a king of Sweden and V&#246;lund&#8217;s father a king of the Finns, supplying the name Ulfsjar for the lake, identifying the swan-maidens as Valkyries, and giving Kjar a home in Valland.

Line 2 of the original is identical with the phrase added by Bugge in stanza 6.

Some editors make lines 1&#8211;2 into a separate stanza, linking lines 3&#8211;5 (or 4&#8211;5) with stanza 16. Line 3 is very possibly spurious, a mere expansion of &#8220;Nithuth spake.&#8221; Nithuth, of course, has come with his men to capture V&#246;lund, and now charges him with having stolen his treasure.

If lines 1&#8211;2 belong to V&#246;lund, they mean that Nithuth got his wealth in the Rhine country, and that V&#246;lund&#8217;s hoard has nothing to do with it; if the speaker is Nithuth, they mean that V&#246;lund presumably has not killed a dragon, and that he is far from the wealth of the Rhine, so that he must have stolen his treasure from Nithuth himself.

Certainly it is Nithuth&#8217;s wife who utters line 4. <hi>Who comes from the wood</hi>: V&#246;lund, noted as a hunter.

It is, indeed, scarcely possible to make any unqualified statement regarding these three poems for which a flat contradiction cannot be found in the writings of some scholar of distinction. The origin of the Helgi tradition, its connection with that of Sigurth, the authorship, date and home of the poems, the degree to which they have been altered from their original forms, the status of the composer of the copious prose notes: these and many other allied questions have been and probably always will be matters of dispute among students of the <hi>Edda&#8217;s</hi> history.
</p><p>Without attempting to enter into the discussion in detail, certain theories should be noted. Helgi appears originally to have been a Danish popular hero, the son of King Halfdan. Saxo Grammaticus has a good deal to say about him in that capacity, and it has been pointed out that many of the place names in the Helgi lays can be pretty clearly identified with parts of Denmark and neighboring stretches of the Baltic. The Danish Helgi, according to Saxo, was famed as the conqueror of Hunding and Hothbrodd, the latter as the result of a naval expedition at the head of a considerable fleet.
</p><p>From Denmark the story appears to have spread northward into Norway and westward into the Norse settlements among the islands. Not many of its original features remained, and new ones were added here and there, particularly with regard to Helgi&#8217;s love affair with Sigrun. The victories over Hunding and Hothbrodd, however, were generally retained, and out of material relating to these two fights, and to the Helgi-Sigrun story, were fashioned the two lays of Helgi Hundingsbane.
</p><p>How the Helgi legend became involved with that of the Volsungs is an open question. Both stories travelled from the South, and presumably about the same time, so it is not unnatural <pb id="pb270" n="270" facs="f:304"/>that some confusion should have arisen. At no time, however, was the connection particularly close so far as the actual episodes of the two stories were concerned. In the two lays of Helgi Hundingsbane the relationship is established only by the statement that Helgi was the son of Sigmund and Borghild; Sigurth is not mentioned, and in the lay of Helgi the son of Hjorvarth there is no connection at all. On the other hand, Helgi does not appear in any of the Eddic poems dealing directly with the Volsung stories, although in one passage of doubtful authenticity (cf. <hi>Reginsmol</hi>, introductory note) his traditional enemy, Hunding, does, represented by his sons. In the <hi>Volsungasaga</hi> the story of Helgi, including the fights with Hunding and Hothbrodd and the love affair with Sigrun, is told in chapters 8 and 9 without otherwise affecting the course of the narrative. Here, as in the Helgi lays, Helgi is the son of Sigmund Volsungsson and Borghild; Sigurth, on the other hand, is the son of Sigmund and Hjordis, the latter being the daughter of King Eylimi. Still another son, who complicates both stories somewhat, is Sinfjotli, son of Sigmund and his own sister, Signy. Sinfjotli appears in both of the Helgi Hundingsbane lays and in the <hi>Volsungasaga</hi>, but not in any of the Eddic poems belonging to the Volsung cycle (cf. <hi>Fra Dautha Sinfjotla</hi> and note).
</p><p>There is a certain amount of resemblance between the story of Helgi and Sigrun and that of Sigurth and Brynhild, particularly as the annotator responsible for the prose notes insists that Sigrun was a Valkyrie. Whether this resemblance was the cause of bringing the two stories together, or whether the identification of Helgi as Sigmund&#8217;s son resulted in alterations of the love story in the Helgi poems, cannot be determined.
</p><p>The first of the three Helgi poems, the lay of Helgi the son of Hjorvarth, is a somewhat distant cousin of the other two. The Helgi in question is apparently the same traditional figure, and he leads a naval expedition, but he is not the son of Sigmund, there is no connection with the Volsung cycle, and his wife is Svava, not Sigrun. At the same time, the points of general resemblance with the two Helgi Hundingsbane lays are such as to indicate a common origin, provided one goes far enough back. The annotator brings the stories together by the naive expedient of having Helgi &#8220;born again,&#8221; and not once only, but twice.
<pb id="pb271" n="271" facs="f:305"/></p><p>The first Helgi lay is manifestly in bad shape, and includes at least two distinct poems, differentiated not only by subject-matter but by metrical form. Although the question is debatable, the longer of these poems (stanzas 1&#8211;11 and 31&#8211;43) seems in turn to have been compounded out of fragments of two or more Helgi poems. The first five stanzas are a dialogue between a bird and Atli, one of Hjorvarth&#8217;s followers, concerning the winning of Sigrlin, who is destined to be Hjorvarth&#8217;s wife and Helgi&#8217;s mother. Stanzas 6&#8211;11 are a dialogue between Helgi and a Valkyrie (the accompanying prose so calls her, and identifies her as Svava, but there is nothing in the verse to prove this). Stanzas 12&#8211;30 form a fairly consecutive unit, in which Atli, on guard over Helgi&#8217;s ship, has a vigorous argument with a giantess, Hrimgerth, whence this section has sometimes been called the <hi>Hrimgertharmol</hi> (<hi>Lay of Hrimgerth</hi>). The last section, stanzas 31&#8211;43, is again fairly consecutive, and tells of the death of Helgi following the rash oath of his brother, Hethin, to win Svava for himself.
</p><p>Parts I, II, and IV may all have come from the same poem or they may not; it is quite impossible to tell surely. All of them are generally dated by commentators not later than the first half of the tenth century, whereas the <hi>Hrimgertharmol</hi> (section III) is placed considerably later. When and by whom these fragments were pieced together is another vexed question, and this involves a consideration of the prose notes and links, of which the <hi>Helgakvitha Hjorvarthssonar</hi> has a larger amount than any other poem in the <hi>Edda</hi>. These prose links contain practically all the narrative, the verse being almost exclusively dialogue. Whoever composed them seems to have been consciously trying to bring his chaotic verse material into some semblance of unity, but he did his work pretty clumsily, with manifest blunders and contradictions. Bugge has advanced the theory that these prose passages are to be regarded as an original and necessary part of the work, but this hardly squares with the evidence.
</p><p>It seems probable, rather, that as the Helgi tradition spread from its native Denmark through the Norse regions of the North and West, and became gradually interwoven, although not in essentials, with the other great hero cycle from the South, that of the Volsungs, a considerable number of poems dealing with Helgi were composed, at different times and in different places, <pb id="pb272" n="272" facs="f:306"/>reflecting varied forms of the story. Many generations afterwards, when Iceland&#8217;s literary period had arrived, some zealous scribe committed to writing such poems or fragments of poems as he knew, piecing them together and annotating them on the basis of information which had reached him through other channels. The prose notes to <hi>Helgakvitha Hundingsbana II</hi> frankly admit this patchwork process: a section of four stanzas (13&#8211;16) is introduced with the phrase, &#8220;as is said in the Old Volsung Lay&#8221;; the final prose note cites an incident &#8220;told in the <hi>Karuljoth</hi> (<hi>Lay of Kara</hi>),&#8221; and a two-line speech is quoted &#8220;as it was written before in the <hi>Helgakvitha</hi>.&#8221;
<milestone rend="space" unit="tb"/>
</p><p>The whole problem of the origin, character and home of the Helgi poems has been discussed in great detail by Bugge in his <hi lang="no" xml:lang="no">Helge-Digtene i den &#198;ldre Edda, Deres Hjem og Forbindelser</hi>, which, as translated by W. H. Schofield under the title <hi>The Home of the Eddic Poems</hi>, is available for readers of English. This study is exceedingly valuable, if not in all respects convincing. The whole matter is so complex and so important in the history of Old Norse literature, and any intelligent reading of the Helgi poems is so dependent on an understanding of the conditions under which they have come down to us, that I have here discussed the question more extensively than the scope of a mere introductory note to a single poem would warrant.</p></div2><div2 type="Section"><p id="prose2.2">(I)
</p><p>OF HJORVARTH AND SIGRLIN

</p><p>Hjorvarth was the name of a king, who had four wives: one was called Alfhild, and their son was named Hethin; the second was called S&#230;reith, and their son was named Humlung; the third was called Sinrjoth, and their son was <pb id="pb273" n="273" facs="f:307"/>named Hymling. King Hjorvarth had made a great vow to have as wife whatsoever woman he knew was fairest. He learned that King Svafnir had a daughter fairer than all others, whose name was Sigrlin. Ithmund was the name of one of his jarls; he had a son called Atli, who went to woo Sigrlin on behalf of the king. He dwelt the winter long with King Svafnir. There was a jarl called Franmar, Sigrlin&#8217;s foster-father; his daughter was named Alof. The jarl told him that the maiden&#8217;s hand was denied, and Atli went home. Atli, the jarl&#8217;s son, stood one day in a certain wood; a bird sat in the branches up over him, and it had heard that his men called Hjorvarth&#8217;s wives the fairest of women. The bird twittered, and Atli hearkened to what it spoke. It said:

But when they came up on the mountain, they saw Svavaland burning and mighty dust-clouds from many steeds. The king rode from the mountain forward into the land, and made a night&#8217;s stay hard by a stream. Atli kept watch and went over the stream; he found there a house. A great bird sat on the housetop to guard it, but he was asleep. Atli hurled his spear at the bird and slew it, and in the house he found Sigrlin the king&#8217;s daughter and Alof the jarl&#8217;s daughter, and he brought them both thence with him. Jarl Franmar had changed himself into the likeness of an eagle, and guarded them from the enemy host by magic. Hrothmar was the name of a king, a wooer of Sigrlin; he slew the <pb id="pb276" n="276" facs="f:310"/>king of Svavaland and had plundered and burned his land. King Hjorvarth took Sigrlin, and Atli took Alof.

</p><p>Hethin was at home with his father, King Hjorvarth, in Norway.

Hethin vowed that he would have Svava, Eylimi&#8217;s daughter, the beloved of his brother Helgi; then such great grief seized him that he went forth on wild paths southward over the land, and found Helgi, his brother.

Most editions employ the title here given. <hi>Hjorvarth</hi>: the name is a not uncommon one; <pb id="pb273a" n="273" facs="f:307"/>there are two men of that name mentioned in the mythical-heroic genealogies of the <hi>Hyndluljoth</hi> (stanzas 23 and 28), and Hjorvarth appears in <hi>Helgakvitha Hundingsbana</hi> I (stanza 14) and II (prose after stanza 12) as a son of Hunding. This particular Hjorvarth is called by the annotator, but not directly so in the verse, a king of Norway. The name means &#8220;Sword-Guardian.&#8221; <hi>Four wives</hi>: polygamy, while very infrequent, appears occasionally in the Norse sagas. <hi>Alfhild</hi>: &#8220;Elf-Warrior.&#8221; <hi>Hethin</hi>: &#8220;Fur-Clothed&#8221; (?). <hi>S&#230;reith</hi>: &#8220;Sea-Rider.&#8221; <hi>Sinrjoth</hi>: &#8220;Ever-Red.&#8221; The fourth wife, not here named, may be Sigrlin. It has been suggested that S&#230;reith and Sinrjoth may be northern and southern forms of the same name, as also <hi>Humlung</hi> and <hi>Hymling</hi>, their sons. <hi>Svafnir</hi>: the annotator calls him king of Svavaland, apparently a place on the mainland which could be reached from Norway either by land or by sea. <hi>Sigrlin</hi>: &#8220;The Conquering Serpent.&#8221; <hi>Atli</hi>: Norse form of the Gothic Attila (Etzel). <hi>Alof</hi>: perhaps a feminine form of Olaf. <hi>A bird</hi>: compare the counsel given by the birds to Sigurth after the slaying of Fafnir (<hi>Fafnismol</hi>, stanzas 32&#8211;38). This is one of the many curious resemblances between the Helgi and the Sigurth stories.

The beginning of a new section (II) is indicated in the manuscript only by the unusually large capital letter with which &#8220;Hjorvarth&#8221; begins. <hi>No name</hi>, etc.: this probably means that Helgi had always been so silent that he would answer to no name, with the result that he had none. <hi>Valkyries</hi>: cf. <hi>Voluspo</hi>, 31 and note. The annotator insists here and in the prose after stanza 9 that Svava was a Valkyrie, but there is nothing in the verse to prove it, or, indeed, to identify the Svava of the last section of the poem with the person who gave Helgi his name. In the <hi>Volsungasaga</hi> Sigmund himself names his son Helgi, and gives him a sword, following <hi>Helgakvitha Hundingsbana</hi> I.

It has been suggested, in consequence, that stanzas 10&#8211;11 may be a separate fragment. The verse tells nothing of the battle, merely giving Helgi&#8217;s reproaches to his father for having left Svafnir&#8217;s death and the burning of Svavaland unavenged.
</p><p><hi><ref target="prose2.2.11">Prose</ref>.</hi> The manuscript does not indicate any break, but the episode which forms the basis of the <hi>Hrimgertharmol</hi> (stanzas 12&#8211;30) clearly begins with the slaying of the giant Hati (&#8220;The Hateful&#8221;). <hi>Hatafjord</hi>: &#8220;Hati&#8217;s Fjord.&#8221; <hi>Hrimgerth</hi>: &#8220;Frost-Shrouded&#8221; (?).

</p><p id="n2.2.15"><ab type="parNum"><ref target="lg2.2.15">15</ref>.</ab> The manuscript does not indicate the speaker. The pun on &#8220;Atli&#8221; and &#8220;atall&#8221; (meaning &#8220;ill&#8221;) is untranslatable.

</p><p id="n2.2.19"><ab type="parNum"><ref target="lg2.2.19">19</ref>.</ab> Apparently both Hrimgerth and her mother, Hati&#8217;s wife, had sought to destroy Helgi&#8217;s ships, and had actually killed some of his companions, the sons of <hi>Hlothvarth</hi>, concerning whom nothing more is known. Many editors assume that a stanza containing a speech by Atli has been lost after stanza 19.

</p><p id="n2.2.26"><ab type="parNum"><ref target="lg2.2.26">26</ref>.</ab> Something is clearly wrong with this stanza, and the manuscript indicates line 6 as the beginning of a new one. Perhaps a line (between lines 4 and 5) has been lost, or perhaps the lines in parenthesis are interpolations. Hrimgerth here refers to Svava, or to the protectress with whom the annotator has identified her, as having saved Helgi and his ships from the vengeance of the giantesses. In the original line 1 includes Helgi&#8217;s name, which makes it metrically incorrect.
<pb id="pb283a" n="283" facs="f:317"/></p><p id="n2.2.28"><ab type="parNum"><ref target="lg2.2.28">28</ref>.</ab> Again something is clearly wrong, and the last three lines look like interpolations, though some editors have tried to reconstruct two full stanzas. The passage suggests the identification of the Valkyries with the clouds.
</p><p id="n2.2.29"><ab type="parNum"><ref target="lg2.2.29">29</ref>.</ab> Some editions give this speech to Helgi. <hi>Eastward</hi>: Atli and Helgi have held Hrimgerth in talk till sunrise, and the sun&#8217;s rays turn her into stone.

</p><p><hi><ref target="prose2.2.30">Prose</ref>.</hi> The manuscript does not indicate a new section of the poem. <hi>Eylimi</hi>: cf. note on prose after stanza 9. <hi>Valkyrie</hi>: here, as before, the annotator has apparently nothing but his own imagination on which to base his statement. Svava in the ensuing stanzas certainly does not behave like a Valkyrie. <hi>Norway</hi>: the annotator doubtless based this statement on the reference to Norway in line 2 of stanza 31. <hi>Yule-eve</hi>: the Yule feast, marking the new year, was a great event in the heathen North. It was a time of feasting and merrymaking, vows (&#8220;New Year&#8217;s resolutions&#8221;), ghosts and witches; the spirits had their greatest power on Yule-eve. <hi>The king&#8217;s toast</hi>: vows made at the passing of the king&#8217;s cup at the Yule feast were particularly sacred. <hi>Sacred boar</hi>: a boar consecrated to Freyr, an integral part of the Yule rites. Hethin&#8217;s vow, which is, of course, the vengeance of the troll-woman, is too sacred to be broken, but he immediately realizes the horror of his oath.
<pb id="pb285a" n="285" facs="f:319"/></p><p id="n2.2.31"><ab type="parNum"><ref target="lg2.2.31">31</ref>.</ab> <hi>From Norway</hi>: Bugge uses this phrase as evidence that the poem was composed in one of the Icelandic settlements of the western islands, but as the annotator himself seems to have thought that Hethin came to Helgi by land (&#8220;on wild paths southward&#8221;), this argument does not appear to have much weight.
</p><p id="n2.2.32"><ab type="parNum"><ref target="lg2.2.32">32</ref>.</ab> The second line is conjectural; a line has clearly been lost from this stanza, and various emendations have been suggested.

Reckoning the lapse of time by nights instead of days was a common practice throughout the German and Scandinavian peoples.
</p><p><hi><ref target="prose2.2.34">Prose</ref>.</hi> Some editors place all or part of this prose passage after stanza 35. <hi>Following-spirits</hi>: the &#8220;fylgja&#8221; was a female guardian spirit whose appearance generally betokened death.

</p><p><hi><ref target="prose2.2.43">Prose</ref>.</hi> Regarding this extraordinary bit see the prose note at the end of <hi>Helgakvitha Hundingsbana II</hi>. Gering thinks the reborn Helgi Hjorvarthsson was Helgi Hundingsbane, while Svava, according to the annotator himself, became Sigrun. The point seems to be simply that there were so many Helgi stories current, and the hero died in so many irreconcilable ways, that tradition had to have him born over again, not once only but several times, to accommodate his many deaths, and to avoid splitting him up into several Helgis. Needless to say, the poems themselves know nothing of this rebirth, and we owe the suggestion entirely to the annotator, who probably got it from current tradition.

The first lay of Helgi Hundingsbane is unquestionably one of the latest of the Eddic poems, and was composed probably not earlier than the second quarter of the eleventh century. It presents several unusual characteristics. For one thing, it is among the few essentially narrative poems in the whole collection, telling a consecutive story in verse, and, except for the abusive dialogue between Sinfjotli and Gothmund, which clearly was based on another and older poem, it does so with relatively little use of dialogue. It is, in fact, a ballad, and in the main an exceedingly vigorous one. The annotator, who added his prose narrative notes so freely in the other Helgi poems, here found nothing to do. The available evidence indicates that narrative verse was a relatively late development in Old Norse poetry, and it is significant that most of the poems which consist chiefly, not of dialogue, but of narrative stanzas, such as the first Helgi Hundingsbane lay and the two Atli lays, can safely be dated, on the basis of other evidence, after the year 1000.
</p><p>The first Helgi Hundingsbane lay is again differentiated from most of the Eddic poems by the character of its language. It is full of those verbal intricacies which were the delight of the Norse skalds, and which made Snorri&#8217;s dictionary of poetic phrases an absolute necessity. Many of these I have paraphrased in the translation; some I have simplified or wholly avoided. A single line will serve to indicate the character of this form of complex diction (stanza 56, line 4): &#8220;And the horse of the giantess &#160;&#160;|&#160;&#160; raven&#8217;s-food had.&#8221; This means simply that wolves (giantesses habitually rode on wolves) ate the bodies of the dead.
</p><p>Except for its intricacies of diction, and the possible loss of a stanza here and there, the poem is comparatively simple. The story belongs in all its essentials to the Helgi tradition, with the Volsung cycle brought in only to the extent of making Helgi the son of Sigmund, and in the introduction of Sinfjotli, son of Sigmund and his sister Signy, in a passage which has <pb id="pb291" n="291" facs="f:325"/>little or nothing to do with the course of the narrative, and which looks like an expansion of a passage from some older poem, perhaps from the &#8220;old Volsung lay&#8221; to which the annotator of the second Helgi Hundingsbane lay refers (prose after stanza 12). There are many proper names, some of which betray the confusion caused by the blending of the two sets of traditions; for example, Helgi appears indiscriminately as an Ylfing (which presumably he was before the Volsung story became involved) and as a Volsung. Granmar and his sons are called Hniflungs (Nibelungen) in stanza 50, though they seem to have had no connection with this race. The place names have aroused much debate as to the localization of the action, but while some of them probably reflect actual places, there is so much geographical confusion, and such a profusion of names which are almost certainly mythical, that it is hard to believe that the poet had any definite locations in mind.</p></div2><div2 type="Section"><lg id="lg2.3.1" type="Verse"><l><ab type="verseNum"><ref target="n2.3.1">1</ref>.</ab> In olden days, &#160;&#160;|&#160;&#160; when eagles screamed,

The lay of the Volsungs.&#8221; <hi>Eagles</hi>, etc.: the screaming of eagles and water pouring from heaven were portents of the birth of a hero. <hi>Borghild</hi>: Sigmund&#8217;s first wife; <hi>Bralund</hi> was her home, not Sigmund&#8217;s.

This suggests that the poet was aware of the spread of the Helgi story over many lands. <hi>Neri&#8217;s kinswoman</hi>: evidently one of the Norns, but nothing further is known of Neri, and the word may not be a proper name at all.
</p><p id="n2.3.5"><ab type="parNum"><ref target="lg2.3.5">5</ref>.</ab> The manuscript indicates no gap, but it looks as though something had been lost after line 2. <hi>Ylfings&#8217; son</hi>: Sigmund is evidently meant, though calling him an Ylfing (cf. <hi>Hyndluljoth</hi>, 11 and note) is a manifest error. Helgi, in the tradition as it came from Denmark, was undoubtedly an Ylfing, and the poet, in order to combine the two legends, has to treat the Ylfings and Volsungs as if they were the same family.

He was the son of Volsung, great-grandson of Othin. His children by his first wife, Borghild, were Helgi and Hamund (belonging to the Helgi cycle); his son by his second wife, Hjordis, was Sigurth. An incestuous connection with his sister, Signy (cf. Wagner&#8217;s Siegmund and Sieglinde) resulted in the birth of Sinfjotli (cf. <hi>Fra Dautha Sinfjotla</hi> and note).

Regarding <hi>Sigarsvoll</hi> cf. <hi>Helgakvitha Hjorvarthssonar</hi>, stanzas 8 and 35. Saxo mentions a Danish king named Sigar, and the frequency with which the name appears in the Helgi poems may be taken as a reminiscence of Denmark. <hi>Hotun</hi> (&#8220;High Place&#8221;): possibly the village of Tune in Seeland. <hi>Himinvangar</hi> (&#8220;Heaven&#8217;s Field&#8221;): an imaginary place. <hi>Blood-snake</hi>: a sword. <hi>Sinfjotli</hi>: cf. note on stanza 6.

Saxo mentions a Hunding who was a Saxon king ruling in Jutland, probably the origin of Helgi&#8217;s traditional foe.

Here again there is a confusion of traditions; the Valkyries of the <hi>Voluspo</hi> were as essentially Norse as any part of the older mythology. I doubt if a poet much earlier than the author of the first Helgi Hundingsbane lay would have made his Sigrun, daughter of Hogni, a Valkyrie. It is to be noted that the same complication appears in the Sigurth story, where the undoubted Valkyrie, Brynhild-Sigrdrifa (the latter name is really only an epithet) is hopelessly mixed up with the quite human Brynhild, daughter of Buthli.

Gering identifies the name of Yngvi with the god Freyr, but the Volsungs certainly claimed descent from Othin, not Freyr, and there is nothing to indicate that Helgi in the Danish tradition was supposed to be descended from Freyr, whereas his descent from Yngvi Halfdansson fits well with the rest of his story.

The second Helgi Hundingsbane lay is in most respects the exact opposite of the first one: it is in no sense consecutive; it is not a narrative poem, and all or most of it gives evidence of relatively early composition, its origin probably going well back into the tenth century.
</p><p>It is frankly nothing but a piece of, in the main, very clumsy patchwork, made up of eight distinct fragments, pieced together awkwardly by the annotator with copious prose notes. One of these fragments (stanzas 13&#8211;16) is specifically identified as coming from &#8220;the old Volsung lay.&#8221; What was that poem, and how much more of the extant Helgi-lay compilation was taken from it, and did the annotator know more of it than he included in his patchwork? Conclusive answers to these questions have baffled scholarship, and probably always will do so. My own guess is that the annotator knew little or nothing more than he wrote down; having got the first Helgi Hundingsbane lay, which was obviously in fairly good shape, out of the way, he proceeded to assemble all the odds and ends of verse about Helgi which he could get hold of, putting them together on the basis of the narrative told in the first Helgi lay and of such stories as his knowledge of prose sagas may have yielded.
</p><p>Section I (stanzas 1&#8211;4) deals with an early adventure of Helgi&#8217;s, in which he narrowly escapes capture when he ventures into Hunding&#8217;s home in disguise. Section II (stanzas 5&#8211;12) is a dialogue between Helgi and Sigrun at their first meeting. Section III (stanzas 13&#8211;16, the &#8220;old Volsung lay&#8221; group) is another dialogue between Helgi and Sigrun when she invokes his aid to save her from Hothbrodd. Section IV (stanzas 17&#8211;21), which may well be from the same poem as Section III, is made up of speeches by Helgi and Sigrun after the battle in which Hothbrodd is killed; stanza 21, however, is certainly an interpolation from another poem, as it is in a different meter. Section V (stanzas 22&#8211;27) is the dispute between Sinfjotli and Gothmund, evidently <pb id="pb310" n="310" facs="f:344"/>in an older form than the one included in the first Helgi Hundingsbane lay. Section VI (stanzas 28&#8211;37) gives Dag&#8217;s speech to his sister, Sigrun, telling of Helgi&#8217;s death, her curse on her brother and her lament for her slain husband. Section VII (stanza 38) is the remnant of a dispute between Helgi and Hunding, here inserted absurdly out of place. Section VIII (stanzas 39&#8211;50) deals with the return of the dead Helgi and Sigrun&#8217;s visit to him in the burial hill.
</p><p>Sijmons maintains that sections I and II are fragments of the Kara lay mentioned by the annotator in his concluding prose note, and that sections IV, VI, and VIII are from a lost Helgi-Sigrun poem, while Section III comes, of course, from the &#8220;old Volsung lay.&#8221; This seems as good a guess as any other, conclusive proof being quite out of the question.
</p><p>Were it not for sections VI and VIII the poem would be little more than a battle-ground for scholars, but those two sections are in many ways as fine as anything in Old Norse poetry. Sigrun&#8217;s curse of her brother for the slaying of Helgi and her lament for her dead husband, and the extraordinary vividness of the final scene in the burial hill, have a quality which fully offsets the baffling confusion of the rest of the poem.</p></div2><div2 type="Section"><p id="prose2.4">King Sigmund, the son of Volsung, had as wife Borghild, from Bralund. They named their son Helgi, after Helgi Hjorvarthsson; Hagal was Helgi&#8217;s foster-father. Hunding was the name of a powerful king, and Hundland is named from him. He was a mighty warrior, and had many sons with him on his campaigns. There was enmity and strife between these two, King Hunding and <pb id="pb311" n="311" facs="f:345"/>King Sigmund, and each slew the other&#8217;s kinsmen.

</p><p>Granmar was the name of a mighty king, who dwelt at Svarin&#8217;s hill. He had many sons; one was named Hothbrodd, another Gothmund, a third Starkath. Hothbrodd was in a kings&#8217; meeting, and he won the promise of having Sigrun, Hogni&#8217;s daughter, for his wife. But when she heard this, she rode with the Valkyries over air and sea to seek Helgi. Helgi was then at Logafjoll, and had fought with Hunding&#8217;s sons; there he killed Alf and Eyolf, Hjorvarth and Hervarth. He was all weary with battle, and sat under the eagle-stone. There Sigrun found him, and ran to throw her arms about his neck, and kissed him, and told him her tidings, as is set forth in the old Volsung lay:

</p><p>Helgi then assembled a great sea-host and went to Frekastein. On the sea he met a perilous storm; lightning flashed overhead and the bolts struck the ship. They saw in the air that nine Valkyries were riding, and recognized Sigrun among them. Then the storm abated, and they came safe and sound to land. Granmar&#8217;s sons sat on a certain mountain as the ships sailed toward the land. Gothmund leaped on a horse and rode for news to a promontory near the harbor; the Volsungs were even then lowering their sails. Then Gothmund said, as is written before in the Helgi lay:
</p><lg type="Verse"><l>&#8220;Who is the king &#160;&#160;|&#160;&#160; who captains the fleet,
    </l><l>And to the land &#160;&#160;|&#160;&#160; the warriors leads?&#8221;</l></lg><p>Sinfjotli, Sigmund&#8217;s son, answered him, and that too is written.
</p><p>Gothmund rode home with his tidings of the host; <pb id="pb319" n="319" facs="f:353"/>then Granmar&#8217;s sons summoned an army. Many kings came there; there were Hogni, Sigrun&#8217;s father, and his sons Bragi and Dag. There was a great battle, and all Granmar&#8217;s sons were slain and all their allies; only Dag, Hogni&#8217;s son, was spared, and he swore loyalty to the Volsungs. Sigrun went among the dead and found Hothbrodd at the coming of death. She said:
</p><lg id="lg2.4.17" type="Verse"><l><ab type="verseNum"><ref target="n2.4.17">17</ref>.</ab> &#8220;Never shall Sigrun &#160;&#160;|&#160;&#160; from Sevafjoll,

</p><p>One of Sigrun&#8217;s maidens went one evening to Helgi&#8217;s hill, and saw that Helgi rode to the hill with many men. The maiden said:

He might equally well have said that the new Helgi was the old one born again, as he accounts for Sigrun in this way (&#8220;she was Svava reborn&#8221;). <hi>Hagal</hi>: not elsewhere mentioned; it was a common custom to have boys brought up by foster-parents. <hi>Hunding</hi> and <hi>Hundland</hi>: cf. <hi>Helgakvitha Hundingsbana I</hi>, 10 and note. <hi>Volsungs</hi> and <hi>Ylfings</hi>: regarding this confusion of family names cf. <hi>Helgakvitha Hundingsbana I</hi>, 5 and note. <hi>H&#230;ming</hi>: his name does not appear in the list of Hunding&#8217;s sons. It is quite possible that these opening stanzas (1&#8211;4) do not refer to Hunding at all.
</p><p id="n2.4.1"><ab type="parNum"><ref target="lg2.4.1">1</ref>.</ab> Helgi appears to have stayed with Hunding under the name of Hamal, but now, thinking himself safe, he sends word of who he really is. <hi>Hunding</hi>: it has been suggested that the compiler may have inserted this name to fit what he thought the story ought to be, in place of H&#230;ming, or even Hadding. If stanzas 1&#8211;4 are a fragment of the <hi>Karuljoth</hi> (<hi>Lay of Kara</hi>), this latter suggestion is quite reasonable, for in that poem, which we do not possess, but which supplied material for the compilers of the <hi>Hromundar saga Greipssonar</hi>, Helgi appears as Helgi Haddingjaskati (cf. final prose note). Nothing beyond this one name connects stanzas 1&#8211;4 with Hunding.

There is nothing in stanzas 5&#8211;12 which clearly identifies Sigrun as a Valkyrie, or which, except for the last line of stanza 12, identifies the speaker as Sigrun. Some editors, therefore, call her simply &#8220;the Valkyrie,&#8221; while <pb id="pb314a" n="314" facs="f:348"/>Vigfusson, who thinks this section is also a remnant of the <hi>Karuljoth</hi>, calls her Kara.

</p><p><hi><ref target="prose2.4.12">Prose</ref>.</hi> The manuscript indicates no division. Most of this prose passage is evidently based on <hi>Helgakvitha Hundingsbana I</hi>; the only new features are the introduction of <hi>Starkath</hi> as a third son of Granmar, which is clearly an error based on a misunderstanding of stanza 19, and the reference to the <hi>kings&#8217; meeting</hi>, based on stanza 15. Kings&#8217; meetings, or councils, were by no means unusual; the North in early days was prolific in kings.

This confusion has given rise to various editorial conjectures.
</p><p><hi><ref target="prose2.4.16">Prose</ref>.</hi> The manuscript indicates no division.

The only new features are the names of Hogni&#8217;s sons, <hi>Bragi</hi> and <hi>Dag</hi>. Bragi is mentioned in stanza 18, though it is not there stated that he is Hogni&#8217;s son. Dag, who figures largely in stanzas 28&#8211;34, is a puzzle, for the verse never names him, and it is an open question where the annotator got his name. <hi>Frekastein</hi>: cf. <hi>Helgakvitha Hjorvarthssonar</hi>, 39 and note. <hi>As is written</hi>: the two lines are quoted, with a change of two words, from <hi>Helgakvitha Hundingsbana I</hi>, 33. <hi>Sinfjotli</hi>: cf. <hi>Helgakvitha Hundingsbana I</hi>, 6 and note, and stanzas 33&#8211;48, in which the whole dialogue is given. <hi>Loyalty</hi>: apparently the annotator got this bit of information out of stanza 29, in which Sigrun refers to the oaths which her brother had sworn to Helgi.

</p><p id="n2.4.18"><ab type="parNum"><ref target="lg2.4.18">18</ref>.</ab> <hi>Maid</hi>: the word thus rendered is the same doubtful one which appears in <hi>V&#246;lundarkvitha</hi>, 1 and 5, and which may mean specifically a Valkyrie (Gering translates it &#8220;helmed&#8221; or &#8220;heroic&#8221;) or simply &#8220;wise.&#8221; Cf. <hi>V&#246;lundarkvitha</hi>, note on introductory prose. <hi>Norns</hi>: cf. <hi>Voluspo</hi>, 20 and note.

</p><p id="n2.4.19"><ab type="parNum"><ref target="lg2.4.19">19</ref>.</ab> This stanza looks like an interpolation, and there is little <pb id="pb320a" n="320" facs="f:354"/>or nothing to connect it with the slaying of Granmar&#8217;s sons. In the manuscript line 2, indicated as the beginning of a stanza, precedes line 1. <hi>Hlebjorg</hi> (&#8220;Sea-Mountain&#8221;) and <hi>Styrkleifar</hi> (&#8220;Battle-Cliffs&#8221;): place names not elsewhere mentioned. Of <hi>Hrollaug&#8217;s sons</hi> nothing further is known. <hi>Starkath</hi>: this name gives a hint of the origin of this stanza, for Saxo Grammaticus tells of the slaying of the Swedish hero Starkath (&#8220;The Strong&#8221;) the son of Storverk, and describes how his severed head bit the ground in anger (cf. line 4). In all probability this stanza is from an entirely different poem, dealing with the Starkath story, and the annotator&#8217;s attempt to identify the Swedish hero as a third son of Granmar is quite without foundation.
</p><p id="n2.4.21"><ab type="parNum"><ref target="lg2.4.21">21</ref>.</ab> The difference of meter would of itself be enough to indicate that this stanza comes from an entirely different poem. A few editions assign the whole stanza to Helgi, but lines 3&#8211;4 are almost certainly Sigrun&#8217;s, and the manuscript begins line 3 with a large capital letter following a period.
<pb id="pb321a" n="321" facs="f:355"/></p><p id="n2.4.22"><ab type="parNum"><ref target="lg2.4.22">22</ref>.</ab> With this stanza begins the dispute between Gothmund and Sinfjotli which, together with Helgi&#8217;s rebuke to his half-brother, appears at much greater length in <hi>Helgakvitha Hundingsbana</hi> I, 33&#8211;48. It is introduced here manifestly in the wrong place. The version here given is almost certainly the older of the two, but the resemblance is so striking, and in some cases (notably in Helgi&#8217;s rebuke) the stanzas are so nearly identical, that it seems probable that the composer of the first Helgi Hundingsbane lay borrowed directly from the poem of which the present dialogue is a fragment. <hi>Flag</hi>: the banner (&#8220;gunnfani,&#8221; cf. &#8220;gonfalon&#8221;) here serves as the signal for war instead of the red shield mentioned in <hi>Helgakvitha Hundingsbana</hi> I, 34. <hi>Battle-light</hi>: perhaps the &#8220;northern lights.&#8221;
</p><p id="n2.4.23"><ab type="parNum"><ref target="lg2.4.23">23</ref>.</ab> Lines 3&#8211;4 are obscure, and in the manuscript show signs of error.

As in the case of Helgi Hjorvarthsson, the theory of the hero&#8217;s rebirth seems to have developed in order to unite around a single Helgi <pb id="pb331" n="331" facs="f:365"/>the various stories in which the hero is slain. The <hi>Lay of Kara</hi> (<hi>Karuljoth</hi>) is lost, although, as has been pointed out, parts of the <hi>Helgakvitha Hundingsbana II</hi> may be remnants of it, but we find the main outlines of the story in the <hi>Hromundar saga Greipssonar</hi>, whose compilers appear to have known the <hi>Karuljoth</hi>. In the saga Helgi Haddingjaskati (Helgi the Haddings&#8217;-Hero) is protected by the Valkyrie Kara, who flies over him in the form of a swan (note once more the Valkyrie swan-maiden confusion); but in his fight with Hromund he swings his sword so high that he accidentally gives Kara a mortal wound, whereupon Hromund cuts off his head. As this makes the third recorded death of Helgi (once at the hands of Alf, once at those of Dag, and finally in the fight with Hromund), the phenomenon of his rebirth is not surprising. The points of resemblance in all the Helgi stories, including the one told in the lost <hi>Karuljoth</hi>, are sufficiently striking so that it is impossible not to see in them a common origin, and not to believe that Helgi the son of Hjorvarth, Helgi the son of Sigmund and Helgi the Haddings&#8217;-Hero (not to mention various other Helgis who probably figured in songs and stories now lost) were all originally the same Helgi who appears in the early traditions of Denmark.

Introductory Note to <hi>Helgakvitha Hjorvarthssonar</hi>). The connecting links between these two sets of stories were few in number, the main point being the identification of Helgi as a son of Sigmund Volsungsson. Another son of Sigmund, however, appears in the Helgi poems, though not in any of the poems dealing with the Volsung cycle proper. This is Sinfjotli, whose sole function in the extant Helgi lays is to have a wordy dispute with Gothmund Granmarsson.
</p><p>Sinfjotli&#8217;s history is told in detail in the early chapters of the <hi>Volsungasaga</hi>. The twin sister of Sigmund Volsungsson, Signy, had married Siggeir, who hated his brother-in-law by reason of his desire to possess a sword which had belonged to Othin and been won by Sigmund. Having treacherously invited Volsung and his ten sons to visit him, Siggeir slew Volsung and captured his sons, who were set in the stocks. Each night a wolf (&#8220;some men say that she was Siggeir&#8217;s mother&#8221;) came out of the woods and ate up one of the brothers, till on the tenth night Sigmund alone was left. Then, however, Signy aided him to escape, and incidentally to kill the wolf. He vowed vengeance on Siggeir, and Signy, who hated her husband, was determined to help him. Convinced that Sigmund must have a helper of his own race, Signy changed forms with a witch, and in this guise sought out Sigmund, who, not knowing who she was, spent three nights with her. Thereafter she gave birth to a boy, whom she named Sinfjotli (&#8220;The Yellow-Spotted&#8221;?), whom she sent to Sigmund. For a time they lived in the woods, occasionally turning into wolves (whence perhaps Sinfjotli&#8217;s name). When Sinfjotli was full grown, he and his father came to Siggeir&#8217;s house, but were seen and betrayed by the two young sons of Signy and Siggeir, whereupon Sinfjotli slew them. Siggeir promptly had Sigmund and Sinfjotli buried alive, but Signy managed to smuggle Sigmund&#8217;s famous sword into the grave, and with this the father and son dug themselves out. The next night they burned Siggeir&#8217;s <pb id="pb333" n="333" facs="f:367"/>house, their enemy dying in the flames, and Signy, who had at the last refused to leave her husband, from a sense of somewhat belated loyalty, perishing with him.
</p><p>Was this story, which the <hi>Volsungasaga</hi> relates in considerable detail, the basis of an old poem which has been lost? Almost certainly it was, although, as I have pointed out, many if not most of the old stories appear to have been handed down rather in prose than in verse, for the <hi>Volsungasaga</hi> quotes two lines of verse regarding the escape from the grave. At any rate, Sinfjotli early became a part of the Volsung tradition, which, in turn, formed the basis for no less than fifteen poems generally included in the Eddic collection. Of this tradition we may recognize three distinct parts: the Volsung-Sigmund-Sinfjotli story; the Helgi story, and the Sigurth story, the last of these three being by far the most extensive, and suggesting an almost limitless amount of further subdivision. With the Volsung-Sigmund-Sinfjotli story the Sigurth legend is connected only by the fact that Sigurth appears as Sigmund&#8217;s son by his last wife, Hjordis; with the Helgi legend it is not connected directly at all. Aside from the fact that Helgi appears as Sigmund&#8217;s son by his first wife, Borghild, the only link between the Volsung story proper and that of Helgi is the appearance of Sinfjotli in two of the Helgi poems. Originally it is altogether probable that the three stories, or sets of stories, were entirely distinct, and that Sigurth (the familiar Siegfried) had little or nothing more to do with the Volsungs of northern mythological-heroic tradition than he had with Helgi.
</p><p>The annotator or compiler of the collection of poems preserved in the <hi lang="la" xml:lang="la">Codex Regius</hi>, having finished with the Helgi lays, had before him the task of setting down the fifteen complete or fragmentary poems dealing with the Sigurth story. Before doing this, however, he felt it incumbent on him to dispose of both Sigmund and Sinfjotli, the sole links with the two other sets of stories. He apparently knew of no poem or poems concerning the deaths of these two; perhaps there were none, though this is unlikely. Certainly the story of how Sinfjotli and Sigmund died was current in oral prose tradition, and this story the compiler set forth in the short prose passage entitled <hi>Of Sinfjotli&#8217;s Death</hi> which, in <hi>Regius</hi>, immediately follows the second lay of Helgi Hundingsbane. The relation of this passage to the prose of the <hi>Reginsmol</hi> is discussed in the introductory note to that poem.</p></div2><div2 type="Section"><pb id="pb334" n="334" facs="f:368"/><p id="prose2.5">Sigmund, the son of Volsung, was a king in the land of the Franks; Sinfjotli was his eldest son, the second was Helgi, and the third Hamund. Borghild, Sigmund&#8217;s wife, had a brother who was named &#8212;&#8212;. Sinfjotli, her stepson, and &#8212;&#8212; both wooed the same woman, wherefore Sinfjotli slew him. And when he came home, Borghild bade him depart, but Sigmund offered her atonement-money, and this she had to accept. At the funeral feast Borghild brought in ale; she took poison, a great horn full, and brought it to Sinfjotli. But when he looked into the horn, he saw that it was poison, and said to Sigmund: &#8220;Muddy is the drink, Father!&#8221; Sigmund took the horn and drank therefrom. It is said that Sigmund was so hardy that poison might not harm him, either outside or in, but all his sons could withstand poison only without on their skin. Borghild bore another horn to Sinfjotli and bade him drink, and all happened as before. And yet a third time she brought him a horn, and spoke therewith scornful <pb id="pb335" n="335" facs="f:369"/>words of him if he should not drink from it. He spoke as before with Sigmund. The latter said: &#8220;Let it trickle through your beard, Son!&#8221; Sinfjotli drank, and straightway was dead. Sigmund bore him a long way in his arms, and came to a narrow and long fjord, and there was a little boat and a man in it. He offered to take Sigmund across the fjord. But when Sigmund had borne the corpse out into the boat, then the craft was full. The man told Sigmund to go round the inner end of the fjord. Then the man pushed the boat off, and disappeared.
</p><p>King Sigmund dwelt long in Denmark in Borghild&#8217;s kingdom after he had married her. Thereafter Sigmund went south into the land of the Franks, to the kingdom which he had there. There he married Hjordis, the daughter of King Eylimi; their son was Sigurth. King Sigmund fell in a battle with the sons of Hunding, and Hjordis then married Alf the son of King Hjalprek. There Sigurth grew up in his boyhood. Sigmund and all his sons were far above all other men in might and stature and courage and every kind of ability. Sigurth, however, was the foremost of all, and all men call him in the old tales the noblest of mankind and the mightiest leader.

In the <hi>Volsungasaga</hi> Borghild bids Sinfjotli drink &#8220;if he has the courage of a Volsung.&#8221; Sigmund gives his advice because &#8220;the king was very drunk, and that was why he spoke thus.&#8221; Gering, on the other hand, gives Sigmund credit for having believed that the draught would deposit its poisonous <pb id="pb335a" n="335" facs="f:369"/>contents in Sinfjotli&#8217;s beard, and thus do him no harm. <hi>Boat</hi>: the man who thus carries off the dead Sinfjotli in his boat is presumably Othin. <hi>Denmark</hi>: Borghild belongs to the Danish Helgi part of the story. <hi>The Franks</hi>: with this the Danish and Norse stories of Helgi and Sinfjotli come to an end, and the Frankish story of Sigurth begins. Sigmund&#8217;s two kingdoms are an echo of the blended traditions. <hi>Hjordis</hi>: just where this name came from is not clear, for in the German story Siegfried&#8217;s mother is Sigelint, but the name of the father of Hjordis, <hi>Eylimi</hi>, gives a clew, for Eylimi is the father of Svava, wife of Helgi Hjorvarthsson. <pb id="pb336" n="336" facs="f:370"/>Doubtless the two men are not identical, but it seems likely that both Eylimi and Hjordis were introduced into the Sigmund-Sigurth story, the latter replacing Sigelint, from some version of the Helgi tradition. <hi>Hunding</hi>: in the Helgi lays the sons of Hunding are all killed, but they reappear here and in two of the poems (<hi>Gripisspo</hi>, 9, and <hi>Reginsmol</hi>, 15), and the <hi>Volsungasaga</hi> names Lyngvi as the son of Hunding who, as the rejected lover of Hjordis, kills Sigmund and his father-in-law, Eylimi, as well. The episode of Hunding and his sons belongs entirely to the Danish (Helgi) part of the story; the German legend knows nothing of it, and permits the elderly Sigmund to outlive his son. There was doubtless a poem on this battle, for the <hi>Volsungasaga</hi> quotes two lines spoken by the dying Sigmund to Hjordis before he tells her to give the pieces of his broken sword to their unborn son. <hi>Alf</hi>: after the battle, according to the <hi>Volsungasaga</hi>, Lyngvi Hundingsson tried to capture Hjordis, but she was rescued by the sea-rover Alf, son of King Hjalprek of Denmark, who subsequently married her.

It is unquestionably one of the latest of the poems in the Eddic collection; most critics agree in calling it the latest of all, dating it not much before the year 1200. Its author (for in this instance the word may be correctly used) was not only familiar with the other poems of the Sigurth cycle, but seems to have had actual written copies of them before him; it has, indeed, been suggested, and not without plausibility, that the <hi>Gripisspo</hi> may have been written by the very man who compiled and annotated the collection of poems preserved in the <hi lang="la" xml:lang="la">Codex Regius</hi>.
</p><p>In form the poem is a dialogue between the youthful Sigurth and his uncle, Gripir, but in substance it is a condensed outline of Sigurth&#8217;s whole career as told piecemeal in the older poems. The writer was sufficiently skillful in the handling of verse, but he was utterly without inspiration; his characters are devoid of vitality, and their speeches are full of conventional phrases, with little force or incisiveness. At the same time, the poem is of considerable interest as giving, in brief form, a summary of the story of Sigurth as it existed in Iceland (for the <hi>Gripisspo</hi> is almost certainly Icelandic) in the latter half of the twelfth century.
</p><p>It is not desirable here to go in detail into the immensely complex question of the origin, growth, and spread of the story of Sigurth (Siegfried). The volume of critical literature on the subject is enormous, and although some of the more patently absurd theories have been eliminated, there are still wide divergencies of opinion regarding many important points. At the same time, a brief review of the chief facts is necessary in order to promote a clearer understanding of the poems which follow, and which make up more than a third of the Eddic collection.
</p><p>That the story of Sigurth reached the North from Germany, having previously developed among the Franks of the Rhine country, is now universally recognized. How and when it spread from northwestern Germany into Scandinavia are less certainly known. It spread, indeed, in every direction, so that traces of it <pb id="pb338" n="338" facs="f:372"/>are found wherever Frankish influence was extensively felt; but it was clearly better known and more popular in Norway, and in the settlements established by Norwegians, than anywhere else. We have historical proof that there was considerable contact, commercial and otherwise, between the Franks of northwestern Germany and the Norwegians (but not the Swedes or the Danes) throughout the period from 600 to 800; coins of Charlemagne have been found in Norway, and there is other evidence showing a fairly extensive interchange of ideas as well as of goods. Presumably, then, the story of the Frankish hero found its way into Norway in the seventh century. While, at this stage of its development, it may conceivably have included a certain amount of verse, it is altogether probable that the story as it came into Norway in the seventh century was told largely in prose, and that, even after the poets had got hold of it, the legend continued to live among the people in the form of oral prose saga.
</p><p>The complete lack of contemporary material makes it impossible for us to speak with certainty regarding the character and content of the Sigurth legend as it existed in the Rhine country in the seventh century. It is, however, important to remember the often overlooked fact that any popular traditional hero became a magnet for originally unrelated stories of every kind. It must also be remembered that in the early Middle Ages there existed no such distinction between fiction and history as we now make; a saga, for instance, might be anything from the most meticulously accurate history to the wildest of fairy tales, and a single saga might (and sometimes did) combine both elements. This was equally true of the Frankish traditions, and the two principles just stated account for most of the puzzling phenomena in the growth of the Sigurth story.
</p><p>Of the origin of Sigurth himself we know absolutely nothing. No historical analogy can be made to fit in the slightest degree. If one believes in the possibility of resolving hero stories into nature myths, he may be explained in that fashion, but such a solution is not necessary. The fact remains that from very early days Sigurth (Sifrit) was a great traditional hero among the Franks. The tales of his strength and valor, of his winning of a great treasure, of his wooing a more or less supernatural bride, and of his death at the hands of his kinsmen, probably were early features of this legend.
</p><p>The next step was the blending of this story with one which <pb id="pb339" n="339" facs="f:373"/>had a clear basis in history. In the year 437 the Burgundians, under their king, Gundicarius (so the Latin histories call him), were practically annihilated by the Huns. The story of this great battle soon became one of the foremost of Rhineland traditions; and though Attila was presumably not present in person, he was quite naturally introduced as the famous ruler of the invading hordes. The dramatic story of Attila&#8217;s death in the year 453 was likewise added to the tradition, and during the sixth century the chain was completed by linking together the stories of Sigurth and those of the Burgundian slaughter. Gundicarius becomes the Gunther of the <hi>Nibelungenlied</hi> and the Gunnar of the Eddic poems; Attila becomes Etzel and Atli. A still further development came through the addition of another, and totally unrelated, set of historical traditions based on the career of Ermanarich, king of the Goths, who died about the year 376. Ermanarich figures largely in many stories unconnected with the Sigurth cycle, but, with the zeal of the medieval story-tellers for connecting their heroes, he was introduced as the husband of Sigurth&#8217;s daughter, Svanhild, herself originally part of a separate narrative group, and as Jormunrek he plays a considerable part in a few of the Eddic poems.
</p><p>Such, briefly, appears to have been the development of the legend before it came into Norway. Here it underwent many changes, though the clear marks of its southern origin were never obliterated. The names were given Scandinavian forms, and in some cases were completely changed (e.g., Kriemhild becomes Guthrun). New figures, mostly of secondary importance, were introduced, and a large amount of purely Northern local color was added. Above all, the earlier part of the story was linked with Northern mythology in a way which seems to have had no counterpart among the southern Germanic peoples. The Volsungs become direct descendants of Othin; the gods are closely concerned with Fafnir&#8217;s treasure, and so on. Above all, the Norse story-tellers and poets changed the figure of Brynhild. In making her a Valkyrie, sleeping on the flame-girt rock, they were never completely successful, as she persisted in remaining, to a considerable extent, the entirely human daughter of Buthli whom Sigurth woos for Gunnar. This confusion, intensified by a mixing of names (cf. <hi>Sigrdrifumol</hi>, introductory note), and much resembling that which existed in the parallel cases of Svava and Sigrun in the Helgi tradition, created difficulties <pb id="pb340" n="340" facs="f:374"/>which the Norse poets and story-tellers were never able to smooth out, and which have perplexed commentators ever since.

</p><p>Those who read the Sigurth poems in the <hi>Edda</hi>, or the story told in the <hi>Volsungasaga</hi>, expecting to find a critically accurate biography of the hero, will, of course, be disappointed. If, however, they will constantly keep in mind the general manner in which the legend grew, its accretions ranging all the way from the Danube to Iceland, they will find that most of the difficulties are simply the natural results of conflicting traditions. Just as the Danish Helgi had to be &#8220;reborn&#8221; twice in order to enable three different men to kill him, so the story of Sigurth, as told in the Eddic poems, involves here and there inconsistencies explicable only when the historical development of the story is taken into consideration.</p></div2><div2 type="Section"><p id="prose2.6">Gripir was the name of Eylimi&#8217;s son, the brother of Hjordis; he ruled over lands and was of all men the wisest and most forward-seeing.

</p><p id="n2.6.13"><ab type="parNum"><ref target="lg2.6.13">13</ref>.</ab> <hi>Gjuki</hi>: the Norse form of the name Gibeche (&#8220;The Giver&#8221;). Gjuki is the father of Gunnar, Hogni, and Guthrun, the family which reflects most directly the Burgundian part of <pb id="pb344a" n="344" facs="f:378"/>the tradition (cf. Introductory Note). The statement that Sigurth is to go direct from the slaying of Fafnir to Gjuki&#8217;s hall involves one of the confusions resulting from the dual personality of Brynhild. In the older (and the original South Germanic) story, Sigurth becomes a guest of the Gjukungs before he has ever heard of Brynhild, and first sees her when, having changed forms with Gunnar, he goes to woo her for the latter. In another version he finds Brynhild before he visits the Gjukungs, only to forget her as the result of the magic draught administered by Guthrun&#8217;s mother. Both these versions are represented in the poems of which the author of the <hi>Gripisspo</hi> made use, and he tried, rather clumsily, to combine them, by having Sigurth go to Gjuki&#8217;s house, then find the unnamed Valkyrie, and then return to Gjuki, the false wooing following this second visit.
</p><p id="n2.6.15"><ab type="parNum"><ref target="lg2.6.15">15</ref>.</ab> Basing his story on the <hi>Sigrdrifumol</hi>, the poet here tells of Sigurth&#8217;s finding of the Valkyrie, whom he does not identify with Brynhild, daughter of Buthli (stanza 27), at all. His error in this respect is not surprising, in view of Brynhild&#8217;s dual identity (cf. Introductory Note, and <hi>Fafnismol</hi>, 44 and note). <pb id="pb345a" n="345" facs="f:379"/><hi>Helgi</hi>: according to <hi>Helreith Brynhildar</hi> (stanza 8), with which the author of the <hi>Gripisspo</hi> was almost certainly familiar, the hero for whose death Brynhild was punished was named Hjalmgunnar. Is Helgi here identical with Hjalmgunnar, or did the author make a mistake? Finnur Jonsson thinks the author regarded Sigurth&#8217;s Valkyrie as a fourth incarnation of Svava-Sigrun-Kara, and wrote Helgi&#8217;s name in deliberately. Many editors, following Bugge, have tried to reconstruct line 2 so as to get rid of Helgi&#8217;s name.
</p><p id="n2.6.19"><ab type="parNum"><ref target="lg2.6.19">19</ref>.</ab> <hi>Heimir</hi>: the <hi>Volsungasaga</hi> says that Heimir was the husband of Brynhild&#8217;s sister, Bekkhild. Brynhild&#8217;s family connections <pb id="pb346a" n="346" facs="f:380"/>involve a queer mixture of northern and southern legend. Heimir and Bekkhild are purely of northern invention; neither of them is mentioned in any of the earlier poems, though Brynhild speaks of her &#8220;foster-father&#8221; in <hi>Helreith Brynhildar</hi>. In the older Norse poems Brynhild is a sister of Atli (Attila), a relationship wholly foreign to the southern stories, and the father of this strangely assorted pair is Buthli, who in the <hi>Nibelungenlied</hi> is apparently Etzel&#8217;s grandfather. Add to this her role of Valkyrie, and it is small wonder that the annotator himself was puzzled.

The <hi>Volsungasaga</hi> tells how Grimhild gave Sigurth a magic draught which made him utterly forget Brynhild.

In the northern version Sigurth and Gunnar change forms, &#8220;as Grimhild had taught them how to do.&#8221; The <hi>Volsungasaga</hi> tells how Sigurth and Gunnar came to Heimir, who told them that to win Brynhild one must ride through the ring of fire which surrounded her hall (cf. the hall of Mengloth in <hi>Svipdagsmol</hi>). Gunnar tries it, but his horse balks; then he mounts Grani, but Grani will not stir for him. So they change forms, and Sigurth rides Grani through the flames. <hi>Oaths</hi>: the blood-brotherhood sworn by Sigurth, Gunnar, and Hogni makes it impossible for the brothers to kill him themselves, but they finally get around the difficulty by inducing their half-brother, Gotthorm (cf. <hi>Hyndluljoth</hi>, 27 and note) to do it.

</p><p id="n2.6.41"><ab type="parNum"><ref target="lg2.6.41">41</ref>.</ab> Something is clearly wrong with stanzas 41&#8211;43. In the manuscript the order is 41, 43, 42, which brings two of Gripir&#8217;s answers together, followed by two of Sigurth&#8217;s questions. Some editors have arranged the stanzas as in this translation, while others have interchanged 41 and 43. In any case, Sigurth in stanza 42 asks about the &#8220;three nights&#8221; which Gripir has never mentioned. I suspect that lines 3&#8211;4 of stanza 41, which are practically identical with lines 3&#8211;4 of stanza 23, got in here by mistake, replacing two lines which may have run thus: &#8220;With thy sword between, &#160;&#160;|&#160;&#160; three nights thou sleepest / With her thou winnest &#160;&#160;|&#160;&#160; for Gunnar&#8217;s wife.&#8221; The subsequent poems tell how Sigurth laid his sword Gram between himself and Brynhild.
<pb id="pb352a" n="352" facs="f:386"/></p><p id="n2.6.43"><ab type="parNum"><ref target="lg2.6.43">43</ref>.</ab> The simultaneous weddings of Sigurth and Gunnar form a memorable feature of the German tradition as it appears in the <hi>Nibelungenlied</hi>, but in the <hi>Volsungasaga</hi> Sigurth marries Guthrun before he sets off with Gunnar to win Brynhild.
</p><p id="n2.6.45"><ab type="parNum"><ref target="lg2.6.45">45</ref>.</ab> According to the <hi>Volsungasaga</hi>, Sigurth remembers his oaths to Brynhild almost immediately after his return to Gunnar&#8217;s house. Brynhild, on the other hand, knows nothing until the <pb id="pb353a" n="353" facs="f:387"/>famous quarrel between herself and Guthrun at the bath (another reminiscence of the German story), when she taunts Guthrun with Sigurth&#8217;s inferiority to Gunnar, and Guthrun retorts with the statement that it was Sigurth, and not Gunnar, who rode through the flames.
</p><p id="n2.6.47"><ab type="parNum"><ref target="lg2.6.47">47</ref>.</ab> Brynhild tells Gunnar that Sigurth really possessed her during the three nights when he slept by her in Gunnar&#8217;s form, thus violating his oath. Here again there is a confusion of two traditions. If Sigurth did not meet Brynhild until after his oath to Gunnar (cf. note on stanza 13), Brynhild&#8217;s charge is entirely false, as she herself admits in <hi>Helreith Brynhildar</hi>. On the other hand, according to the version in which Sigurth finds Brynhild before he meets Gjuki&#8217;s sons, their union was not only completed, but she had by him a daughter, Aslaug, whom she leaves in Heimir&#8217;s charge before going to become Gunnar&#8217;s wife. This is the <hi>Volsungasaga</hi> version, and thus the statement Brynhild makes to Gunnar, as a result of which Sigurth is slain, is quite true.

In no instance is the title of the poem stated, and in <hi>Regius</hi> there stands before the introductory prose, very faintly written, what appears to be &#8220;Of Sigurth.&#8221; As a result, various titles have been affixed to it, the two most often used being &#8220;the Ballad of Regin&#8221; and &#8220;the First Lay of Sigurth Fafnisbane.&#8221;
</p><p>As a matter of fact, it is by no means clear that the compiler of the Eddic collection regarded this or either of the two following poems, the <hi>Fafnismol</hi> and the <hi>Sigrdrifumol</hi>, as separate and distinct poems at all. There are no specific titles given, and the prose notes link the three poems in a fairly consecutive whole. Furthermore, the prose passage introducing the <hi>Reginsmol</hi> connects directly with <hi>Fra Dautha Sinfjotla</hi>, and only the insertion of the <hi>Gripisspo</hi> at this point, which may well have been done by some stupid copyist, breaks the continuity of the story.
</p><p>For convenience I have here followed the usual plan of dividing this material into distinct parts, or poems, but I greatly doubt if this division is logically sound. The compiler seems, rather, to have undertaken to set down the story of Sigurth in consecutive form, making use of all the verse with which he was familiar, and which, by any stretch of the imagination, could be made to fit, filling up the gaps with prose narrative notes based on the living oral tradition.
</p><p>This view is supported by the fact that not one of the three poems in question, and least of all the <hi>Reginsmol</hi>, can possibly be regarded as a unit. For one thing, each of them includes both types of stanza commonly used in the Eddic poems, and this, notwithstanding the efforts of Grundtvig and M&#252;llenhoff to prove the contrary, is almost if not quite conclusive proof that each poem consists of material taken from more than one source. Furthermore, there is nowhere continuity within the verse itself for more than a very few stanzas. An analysis of the <hi>Reginsmol</hi> shows that stanzas 1&#8211;4, 6&#8211;10, and 12, all in Ljothahattr stanza form, seem to belong together as fragments of a poem dealing with <pb id="pb357" n="357" facs="f:391"/>Loki&#8217;s (not Andvari&#8217;s) curse on the gold taken by the gods from Andvari and paid to Hreithmar, together with Hreithmar&#8217;s death at the hands of his son, Fafnir, as the first result of this curse. Stanza 5, in Fornyrthislag, is a curse on the gold, here ascribed to Andvari, but the only proper name in the stanza, <hi>Gust</hi>, is quite unidentifiable, and the stanza may originally have had to do with a totally different story. Stanza 11, likewise in Fornyrthislag, is merely a father&#8217;s demand that his daughter rear a family to avenge his death; there is nothing in it to link it necessarily with the dying Hreithmar. Stanzas 13&#8211;18, all in Fornyrthislag, give Regin&#8217;s welcome to Sigurth (stanzas 13&#8211;14), Sigurth&#8217;s announcement that he will avenge his father&#8217;s death on the sons of Hunding before he seeks any treasure (stanza 15), and a dialogue between a certain Hnikar, who is really Othin, and Regin, as the latter and Sigurth are on the point of being shipwrecked. This section (stanzas 13&#8211;18) bears a striking resemblance to the Helgi lays, and may well have come originally from that cycle. Next follows a passage in Ljothahattr form (stanzas 19&#8211;22 and 24&#8211;25) in which Hnikar-Othin gives some general advice as to lucky omens and good conduct in battle; the entire passage might equally well stand in the <hi>Hovamol</hi>, and I suspect that it originally came from just such a collection of wise saws. Inserted in this passage is stanza 23, in Fornyrthislag, likewise on the conduct of battle, with a bit of tactical advice included. The &#8220;poem&#8221; ends with a single stanza, in Fornyrthislag, simply stating that the bloody fight is over and that Sigurth fought well&#8212;a statement equally applicable to any part of the hero&#8217;s career.
</p><p>Finnur Jonsson has divided the <hi>Reginsmol</hi> into two poems, or rather into two sets of fragments, but this, as the foregoing analysis has indicated, does not appear to go nearly far enough. It accords much better with the facts to assume that the compiler of the collection represented by the <hi lang="la" xml:lang="la">Codex Regius</hi>, having set out to tell the story of Sigurth, took his verse fragments pretty much wherever he happened to find them. In this connection, it should be remembered that in the fluid state of oral tradition poems, fragments, and stanzas passed readily and frequently from one story to another. Tradition, never critical, doubtless connected with the Sigurth story much verse that never originated there.
</p><p>If the entire passage beginning with the prose <hi>Fra Dautha Sinfjotla</hi>, and, except for the <hi>Gripisspo</hi>, including the <hi>Reginsmol</hi>, <hi>Fafnismol</hi>, and <hi>Sigrdrifumol</hi>, be regarded as a highly uncritical <pb id="pb358" n="358" facs="f:392"/>piece of compilation, rendered consecutive by the compiler&#8217;s prose narrative, its difficulties are largely smoothed away; any other way of looking at it results in utterly inconclusive attempts to reconstruct poems some of which quite possibly never existed.
</p><p>The twenty-six stanzas and accompanying prose notes included under the heading of <hi>Reginsmol</hi> belong almost wholly to the northern part of the Sigurth legend; the mythological features have no counterpart in the southern stories, and only here and there is there any betrayal of the tradition&#8217;s Frankish home. The story of Andvari, Loki, and Hreithmar is purely Norse, as is the concluding section containing Othin&#8217;s counsels. If we assume that the passage dealing with the victory over Hunding&#8217;s sons belongs to the Helgi cycle (cf. introductory notes to <hi>Helgakvitha Hjorvarthssonar</hi> and <hi>Helgakvitha Hundingsbana I</hi>), there is very little left to reflect the Sigurth tradition proper.

At that time Regin, the son of Hreithmar, was come to Hjalprek&#8217;s home; he was more ingenious than all other men, and a dwarf in stature; he was wise, fierce and skilled in magic. Regin undertook Sigurth&#8217;s bringing up and teaching, and loved him much. He told Sigurth of his forefathers, and also of this: that once Othin and H&#246;nir and Loki had come to Andvari&#8217;s waterfall, and in the fall were many fish. Andvari was a dwarf, who had dwelt long in the waterfall in the shape of a pike, and there he got his food. &#8220;Otr was the name of a brother of ours,&#8221; said Regin, &#8220;who often went into the fall in the shape of an otter; he had caught a salmon, and sat on the high bank eating it with his eyes shut. Loki threw a stone at him and killed him; the gods thought they had had great good luck, and <pb id="pb359" n="359" facs="f:393"/>stripped the skin off the otter. That same evening they sought a night&#8217;s lodging at Hreithmar&#8217;s house, and showed their booty. Then we seized them, and told them, as ransom for their lives, to fill the otter skin with gold, and completely cover it outside as well with red gold. Then they sent Loki to get the gold; he went to Ron and got her net, and went then to Andvari&#8217;s fall and cast the net in front of the pike, and the pike leaped into the net.&#8221; Then Loki said:

The <hi>Voluspo</hi> (stanza 12) names a Regin among the dwarfs, and the name may have assisted in making Regin a dwarf here. <hi>Hreithmar</hi>: nothing is known of him outside of this story. <hi>Othin</hi>, <hi>H&#246;nir</hi> and <hi>Loki</hi>: these same three gods appear in company in <hi>Voluspo</hi>, 17&#8211;18. <hi>Andvari&#8217;s fall</hi>: according to Snorri, who tells this entire story in the <hi>Skaldskaparmal</hi>, Andvari&#8217;s fall was in the world of the dark elves, while the one where Loki killed the otter was not; here, however, the two are considered identical. <hi>With his eyes shut</hi>: according to Snorri, Otr ate with his eyes shut because <corr sic="be">he</corr> was so greedy that he could not bear to see the food before him diminishing. <hi>Ron</hi>: wife of the sea-god &#198;gir, who draws down drowning men with her net; cf. <hi>Helgakvitha Hjorvarthssonar</hi>, 18 and note.

Introductory Note. In the <hi>Volsungasaga</hi> Andvari lays his curse particularly on the ring. <hi>Gust</hi>: possibly a name for Andvari himself, or for an earlier possessor of the treasure. <hi>Brothers twain</hi>: Fafnir and Regin. <hi>Heroes eight</hi>: the word &#8220;eight&#8221; may easily have been substituted for something like &#8220;all&#8221; to make the stanza fit the case; the &#8220;eight&#8221; in question are presumably Sigurth, Gotthorm, Gunnar, Hogni, Atli, Erp, Sorli and Hamther, all of whom are slain in the course of the story. But the stanza may originally not have referred to Andvari&#8217;s treasure at all.

Apparently, however, the reference is to the fight between Sigurth and the sons of Gjuki over Brynhild. The manuscript does not name the speaker, and many editions assign this stanza to Hreithmar.
</p><p id="n2.7.9"><ab type="parNum"><ref target="lg2.7.9">9</ref>.</ab> The manuscript includes &#8220;said Hreithmar&#8221; (abbreviated) in the middle of line 1, and some editors have followed this.

</p><p id="n2.7.11"><ab type="parNum"><ref target="lg2.7.11">11</ref>.</ab> Apparently an interpolation (cf. Introductory Note). Vigfusson tries to reconstruct lines 2 and 4 to fit the Ljothahattr rhythm, but without much success. Hreithmar urges his daughter, as she has no sons, to bear a daughter who, in turn, will have a son to avenge his great-grandfather. Grundtvig worked out an ingenious theory to fit this stanza, making Sigurth&#8217;s grandfather, Eylimi, the husband of Lyngheith&#8217;s daughter, but there is absolutely no evidence to support this. The stanza may have nothing to do with Hreithmar.

Calling Sigurth <pb id="pb365a" n="365" facs="f:399"/>a descendant of Yngvi is, of course, absurd, and the use of this phrase is one of the many reasons for believing that stanzas 13&#8211;18 belonged originally to the Helgi cycle. <hi>The threads</hi>, etc.: another link with Helgi; cf. <hi>Helgakvitha Hundingsbana I</hi>, 3&#8211;4.

Although the <hi>Volsungasaga</hi> does not actually quote any of the stanzas, it gives a very close prose parallel to the whole poem in chapters 18 and 19.
</p><p>The general character of the <hi>Fafnismol</hi>, and its probable relation to the <hi>Reginsmol</hi> and the <hi>Sigrdrifumol</hi>, have been discussed in the introductory note to the <hi>Reginsmol</hi>. While it is far more nearly a unit than the <hi>Reginsmol</hi>, it shows many of the same characteristics. It has the same mixture of stanza forms, although in this case only nine stanzas (32&#8211;33, 35&#8211;36 and 40&#8211;44) vary from the normal Ljothahattr measure. It shows, though to a much less marked extent, the same tendency to introduce passages from extraneous sources, such as the question-and-answer passage in stanzas 11&#8211;15. At the same time, in this instance it is quite clear that one distinct poem, including probably stanzas 1&#8211;10, 16&#8211;23, 25&#8211;31, and 34&#8211;39, underlay the compilation which we here have. This may, perhaps, have been a long poem (not, however, the &#8220;Long&#8221; Sigurth Lay; see introductory note to <hi>Brot af Sigurtharkvithu</hi>) dealing with the Regin-Fafnir-Sigurth-Brynhild story, and including, besides most of the <hi>Fafnismol</hi>, stanzas 1&#8211;4 and 6&#8211;11 of the <hi>Reginsmol</hi> and part of the so-called <hi>Sigrdrifumol</hi>, together with much that has been lost. The original poem may, on the other hand, have confined itself to the Fafnir episode.
</p><p>In any case, and while the extant <hi>Fafnismol</hi> can be spoken of as a distinct poem far more justly than the <hi>Reginsmol</hi>, there is still no indication that the compiler regarded it as a poem by itself. His prose notes run on without a break, and the verses simply cover a dramatic episode in Sigurth&#8217;s early life. The fact that the work of compilation has been done more intelligently than in the case of the <hi>Reginsmol</hi> seems to have resulted chiefly from the compiler&#8217;s having been familiar with longer consecutive verse passages dealing with the Fafnir episode. <pb id="pb371" n="371" facs="f:405"/>The <hi>Reginsmol</hi> is little more than a clumsy mosaic, but in the <hi>Fafnismol</hi> it is possible to distinguish between the main substance of the poem and the interpolations.
</p><p>Here, as in the <hi>Reginsmol</hi>, there is very little that bespeaks the German origin of the Sigurth story. Sigurth&#8217;s winning of the treasure is in itself undoubtedly a part of the earlier southern legend, but the manner in which he does it is thoroughly Norse. Moreover, the concluding section, which points toward the finding of the sleeping Brynhild, relates entirely to the northern Valkyrie, the warrior-maiden punished by Othin, and not at all to the southern Brynhild the daughter of Buthli. The <hi>Fafnismol</hi> is, however, sharply distinguished from the <hi>Reginsmol</hi> by showing no clear traces of the Helgi tradition, although a part of the bird song (stanzas 40&#8211;44, in Fornyrthislag form, as distinct from the body of the poem) sounds suspiciously like the bird passage in the beginning of the <hi>Helgakvitha Hjorvarthssonar</hi>. Regarding the general relations of the various sets of traditions in shaping the story of Sigurth, see the introductory note to <hi>Gripisspo</hi>.
</p><p>The <hi>Fafnismol</hi>, together with a part of the <hi>Sigrdrifumol</hi>, has indirectly become the best known of all the Eddic poems, for the reason that Wagner used it, with remarkably little change of outline, as the basis for his &#8220;Siegfried.&#8221;</p></div2><div2 type="Section"><p id="prose2.8">Sigurth and Regin went up to the Gnitaheith, and found there the track that Fafnir made when he crawled to water. Then Sigurth made a great trench across the path, and took his place therein. When Fafnir crawled from his gold, he blew out venom, and it ran down from above on Sigurth&#8217;s head. But when Fafnir crawled over the trench, then Sigurth thrust his sword into his body <pb id="pb372" n="372" facs="f:406"/>to the heart. Fafnir writhed and struck out with his head and tail.

Sigurth was much worried about this danger, and before he dug the trench asked Regin what would happen if the dragon&#8217;s blood overcame him. Regin thereupon taunted him with cowardice (Sigurth refers to this taunt in stanza 30, but the stanza embodying it has disappeared). After Sigurth had dug his trench, an old man (Othin, of course) appeared and advised him to dig other trenches to carry off the blood, which he did, thereby escaping harm.

There are almost as many guesses as there are editions. I suspect that in the original poem there was one bird, speaking stanzas 34 and 37. Stanza 38 is little more than a repetition of stanza 34, and may well have been a later addition. As for the stanzas in Fornyrthislag (32&#8211;33 and 35&#8211;36), they apparently come from another poem, in which several birds speak (cf. &#8220;we sisters&#8221; in stanza 35). This may be the same poem from which stanzas 40&#8211;44 were taken, as well as some of the Fornyrthislag stanzas in the <hi>Sigrdrifumol</hi>.

It seems to me, however, that there are not only two birds, but two distinct stories. Stanzas 40&#8211;41 apply solely to Guthrun, and suggest that Sigurth will go straight to Gunnar&#8217;s hall. Stanzas 42&#8211;44, on the other hand, apply solely to Brynhild, and indicate that Sigurth will find her before he visits the Gjukungs. The confusion which existed between these two versions of the story, and which involved a fundamental difference in the final working out of Brynhild&#8217;s revenge, is commented on in the note on <hi>Gripisspo</hi>, 13. In the present passage it is possible that two birds are speaking, each reflecting one version of the story; it seems even more likely that one speech or the other (40&#8211;41 or 42&#8211;44) reflects the original form of the narrative, the other having been added, either later or from another poem. In the <hi>Volsungasaga</hi> the whole passage is condensed into a few words by one bird: &#8220;Wiser were it if he should then ride up on Hindarfjoll, where Brynhild sleeps, and there would he get much wisdom.&#8221; The Guthrun-bird does not appear at all.

Editors, until recently, <pb id="pb385a" n="385" facs="f:419"/>have followed him in this error, failing to recognize that &#8220;sigrdrifa&#8221; was simply an epithet for Brynhild. It is from this blunder that the so-called <hi>Sigrdrifumol</hi> takes its name. Brynhild&#8217;s dual personality as a Valkyrie and as the daughter of Buthli has made plenty of trouble, but the addition of a second Valkyrie in the person of the supposed &#8220;Sigrdrifa&#8221; has made still more.

The end of it has been entirely lost, for the fifth folio of eight sheets is missing from <hi>Regius</hi>, the gap coming after the first line of stanza 29 of this poem. That stanza has been completed, and eight more have been added, from much later paper manuscripts, but even so the conclusion of the poem is in obscurity.
</p><p>Properly speaking, however, the strange conglomeration of stanzas which the compiler of the collection has left for us, and which, in much the same general form, seems to have lain before the authors of the <hi>Volsungasaga</hi>, in which eighteen of its stanzas are quoted, is not a poem at all. Even its customary title is an absurd error. The mistake made by the annotator in thinking that the epithet &#8220;sigrdrifa,&#8221; rightly applied to Brynhild as a &#8220;bringer of victory,&#8221; was a proper name has already been explained and commented on (note on <hi>Fafnismol</hi>, 44). Even if the collection of stanzas were in any real sense a poem, which it emphatically is not, it is certainly not the &#8220;Ballad of Sigrdrifa&#8221; which it is commonly called. &#8220;Ballad of Brynhild&#8221; would be a sufficiently suitable title, and I have here brought the established name &#8220;Sigrdrifumol&#8221; into accord with this by translating the epithet instead of treating it as a proper name.
</p><p>Even apart from the title, however, the <hi>Sigrdrifumol</hi> has little claim to be regarded as a distinct poem, nor is there any indication that the compiler did so regard it. Handicapped as we are by the loss of the concluding section, and of the material which followed it on those missing pages, we can yet see that the process which began with the prose <hi>Fra Dautha Sinfjotla</hi>, and which, interrupted by the insertion of the <hi>Gripisspo</hi>, went on through the <hi>Reginsmol</hi> and the <hi>Fafnismol</hi>, continued through as much of the <hi>Sigrdrifumol</hi> as is left to us. In other words, the compiler told the story of Sigurth in mixed prose and verse, using whatever verse he could find without much questioning as to its origin, and filling in the gaps with his own prose. <hi>Fra <pb id="pb387" n="387" facs="f:421"/>Dautha Sinfjotla</hi>, <hi>Reginsmol</hi>, <hi>Fafnismol</hi>, and <hi>Sigrdrifumol</hi> are essentially a coherent unit, but one of the compiler&#8217;s making only; they represent neither one poem nor three distinct poems, and the divisions and titles which have been almost universally adopted by editors are both arbitrary and misleading.
</p><p>The <hi>Sigrdrifumol</hi> section as we now have it is an extraordinary piece of patchwork. It is most unlikely that the compiler himself brought all these fragments together for the first time; little by little, through a process of accretion and also, unluckily, through one of elimination, the material grew into its present shape. Certainly the basis of it is a poem dealing with the finding of Brynhild by Sigurth, but of this original poem only five stanzas (2&#8211;4 and 20&#8211;21) can be identified with any degree of confidence. To these five stanzas should probably, however, be added some, if not all, of the passage (stanzas 6&#8211;12) in which Brynhild teaches Sigurth the magic runes. These stanzas of rune-lore attracted sundry similar passages from other sources, including stanza 5, in which a magic draught is administered (not necessarily by Brynhild or to Sigurth), the curious rune-chant in stanzas 15&#8211;17, and stanzas 13&#8211;14 and 18&#8211;19. Beginning with stanza 22, and running to the end of the fragment (stanza 37), is a set of numbered counsels closely resembling the <hi>Loddfafnismol</hi> (<hi>Hovamol</hi>, stanzas 111&#8211;138), which manifestly has nothing whatever to do with Brynhild. Even in this passage there are probably interpolations (stanzas 25, 27, 30, 34, and 36). Finally, and bespeaking the existence at some earlier time of another Sigurth-Brynhild poem, is stanza 1, sharply distinguished by its metrical form from stanzas 2&#8211;4 and 20&#8211;21. Many critics argue that stanzas 6&#8211;10 of <hi>Helreith Brynildar</hi> belonged originally to the same poem as stanza 1 of the <hi>Sigrdrifumol</hi>.
</p><p>The <hi>Sigrdrifumol</hi>, then, must be regarded simply as a collection of fragments, most of them originally having no relation to the main subject. All of the story, the dialogue and the characterization are embodied in stanzas 1&#8211;4 and 20&#8211;21 and in the prose notes accompanying the first four stanzas; all of the rest might equally well (or better) be transferred to the <hi>Hovamol</hi>, where its character entitles it to a place. Yet stanzas 2&#8211;4 are as fine as anything in Old Norse poetry, and it is out of the scanty material of these three stanzas that Wagner constructed much of the third act of &#8220;Siegfried.&#8221;
<pb id="pb388" n="388" facs="f:422"/></p><p>The <hi>Sigrdrifumol</hi> represents almost exclusively the contributions of the North to the Sigurth tradition (cf. introductory note to the <hi>Gripisspo</hi>). Brynhild, here disguised by the annotator as &#8220;Sigrdrifa,&#8221; appears simply as a battle-maid and supernatural dispenser of wisdom; there is no trace of the daughter of Buthli and the rival of Guthrun. There is, however, so little of the &#8220;poem&#8221; which can definitely be assigned to the Sigurth cycle that it is impossible to trace back any of the underlying narrative substance.

In the intervening lost stanzas Brynhild has evidently warned Sigurth of the perils that will follow if he swears loyalty to her; hence the choice to which she here refers. <hi>Tree</hi>, etc.: warrior.

Perhaps they formed part of the stanza of warning which evidently preceded Brynhild&#8217;s speech in stanza 20. In the <hi>Volsungasaga</hi> they are paraphrased at the end of Brynhild&#8217;s long speech of advice (stanzas 20&#8211;37), and are immediately followed by the prose passage given in the note on stanza 21. It seems likely, therefore, <pb id="pb401" n="401" facs="f:435"/>that the paper manuscripts have preserved all of the so-called <hi>Sigrdrifumol</hi> which was contained in the lost section of <hi>Regius</hi>, with the possible exception of these two concluding stanzas, and these may very well have been given only in the form of a prose note, though it is practically certain that at one time they existed in verse form.

There is here little question of such a compilation as made up the so-called <hi>Reginsmol</hi>, <hi>Fafnismol</hi>, and <hi>Sigrdrifumol</hi>; the extant fragment shows every sign of being part of a poem which, as it stood in the manuscript, was a complete and definite unit. The end is clearly marked; the following poem, <hi>Guthrunarkvitha</hi> I, carries a specific heading in the manuscript, so that there is no uncertainty as to where the fragment closes.
</p><p>It seems altogether likely that the twenty stanzas thus remaining are the end of a poem entitled <hi>Sigurtharkvitha</hi> (Lay of Sigurth), and, more specifically, the &#8220;Long&#8221; Lay of Sigurth. The extant and complete Sigurth lay, a relatively late work, is referred to by the annotator as the &#8220;Short&#8221; Lay of Sigurth, which, of course, presupposes the existence of a longer poem with the same title. As the &#8220;short&#8221; lay is one of the longest poems in the whole collection (seventy stanzas), it follows that the other one must have been considerably more extensive in order to have been thus distinguished by its length. It may be guessed, then, that not less than eighty or a hundred stanzas, and possibly more, of the &#8220;Long&#8221; Lay of Sigurth have been lost with the missing pages of <hi>Regius</hi>.
</p><p>The narrative, from the point at which the so-called <hi>Sigrdrifumol</hi> breaks off to that at which the Brot takes it up, is given with considerable detail in the <hi>Volsungasaga</hi>. In this prose narrative four stanzas are quoted, and one of them is specifically introduced with the phrase: &#8220;as is told in the Lay of Sigurth.&#8221; It is possible, but most unlikely, that the entire passage paraphrases this poem alone; such an assumption would give the Lay of Sigurth not less than two hundred and fifty stanzas (allowing about fifteen stanzas to each of the missing pages), and moreover there are inconsistencies in the <hi>Volsungasaga</hi> narrative suggesting that different and more or less conflicting poems were used as sources. The chances are that the &#8220;Long&#8221; Lay of Sigurth <pb id="pb403" n="403" facs="f:437"/>filled approximately the latter half of the lost section of the manuscript, the first half including poems of which the only trace is to be found in the <hi>Volsungasaga</hi> prose paraphrase and in two of the stanzas therein quoted.
</p><p>The course of the <hi>Volsungasaga&#8217;s</hi> story from the <hi>Sigrdrifumol</hi> to the <hi>Brot</hi> is, briefly, as follows. After leaving the Valkyrie, Sigurth comes to the dwelling of Heimir, Brynhild&#8217;s brother-in-law, where he meets Brynhild and they swear oaths of fidelity anew (the <hi>Volsungasaga</hi> is no more lucid with regard to the Brynhild-Sigrdrifa confusion than was the annotator of the poems). Then the scene shifts to the home of the Gjukungs. Guthrun, Gjuki&#8217;s daughter, has a terrifying dream, and visits Brynhild to have it explained, which the latter does by foretelling pretty much everything that is going to happen; this episode was presumably the subject of a separate poem in the lost section of the manuscript. Guthrun returns home, and Sigurth soon arrives, to be made enthusiastically welcome. Grimhild, mother of Gunnar and Guthrun, gives him a magic draught which makes him forget all about Brynhild, and shortly thereafter he marries Guthrun.
</p><p>Then follows the episode of the winning of Brynhild for Gunnar (cf. <hi>Gripisspo</hi>, 37 and note). This was certainly the subject of a poem, possibly of the first part of the &#8220;Long&#8221; Lay of Sigurth, although it seems more likely that the episode was dealt with in a separate poem. The <hi>Volsungasaga</hi> quotes two stanzas describing Sigurth&#8217;s triumphant passing through the flames after Gunnar has failed and the two have changed forms. They run thus:
</p><lg type="Verse"><l>The fire raged, &#160;&#160;|&#160;&#160; the earth was rocked,
    </l><l>The flames leaped high &#160;&#160;|&#160;&#160; to heaven itself;
    </l><l>Few were the hardy &#160;&#160;|&#160;&#160; heroes would dare
    </l><l>To ride or leap &#160;&#160;|&#160;&#160; the raging flames.</l></lg><lg type="Verse"><l>Sigurth urged Grani &#160;&#160;|&#160;&#160; then with his sword,
    </l><l>The fire slackened &#160;&#160;|&#160;&#160; before the hero,
    </l><l>The flames sank low &#160;&#160;|&#160;&#160; for the greedy of fame,
    </l><l>The armor flashed &#160;&#160;|&#160;&#160; that Regin had fashioned.</l></lg><p>After Sigurth has spent three nights with Brynhild, laying his sword between them (cf. <hi>Gripisspo</hi>, 41 and note), he and Gunnar return home, while Brynhild goes to the dwelling of her brother-in-law, Heimir, and makes ready for her marriage with Gunnar, <pb id="pb404" n="404" facs="f:438"/>directing Heimir to care for her daughter by Sigurth, Aslaug. The wedding takes place, to be followed soon after by the quarrel between Guthrun and Brynhild, in which the former betrays the fact that it was Sigurth, and not Gunnar, who rode through the flames. Brynhild speaks with contempt of Guthrun and her whole family, and the following stanza, which presumably belongs to the same Sigurth lay as the <hi>Brot</hi>, is quoted at this point:
</p><lg type="Verse"><l>Sigurth the dragon &#160;&#160;|&#160;&#160; slew, and that
    </l><l>Will men recall &#160;&#160;|&#160;&#160; while the world remains;
    </l><l>But little boldness &#160;&#160;|&#160;&#160; thy brother had
    </l><l>To ride or leap &#160;&#160;|&#160;&#160; the raging flames.</l></lg><p>Gunnar and Sigurth alike try to appease the angry Brynhild, but in vain. After Sigurth has talked with her, his leaving her hall is described in the following stanza, introduced by the specific phrase: &#8220;as is said in the Lay of Sigurth&#8221;:
</p><lg type="Verse"><l>Forth went Sigurth, &#160;&#160;|&#160;&#160; and speech he sought not,
    </l><l>The friend of heroes, &#160;&#160;|&#160;&#160; his head bowed down;
    </l><l>Such was his grief &#160;&#160;|&#160;&#160; that asunder burst
    </l><l>His mail-coat all &#160;&#160;|&#160;&#160; of iron wrought.</l></lg><p>Brynhild then tells Gunnar that she had given herself wholly to Sigurth before she had become Gunnar&#8217;s wife (the confusion between the two stories is commented on in the note to <hi>Gripisspo</hi>, 47), and Gunnar discusses plans of <corr sic="vengance">vengeance</corr> with his brother, Hogni. It is at this point that the action of the <hi>Brot</hi> begins.

This note is of special interest as an effort at real criticism. The annotator, troubled by the two versions of the story of Sigurth&#8217;s death, feels it incumbent on him not only to point the fact out, but to cite the authority of &#8220;German men&#8221; for the form which appears <pb id="pb410a" n="410" facs="f:444"/>in this poem. The alternative version, wherein Sigurth is slain in bed, appears in <hi>Sigurtharkvitha en skamma</hi>, <hi>Guthrunarhvot</hi>, and <hi>Hamthesmol</hi>, and also in the <hi>Volsungasaga</hi>, which tells how Gotthorm tried twice to kill Sigurth but was terrified by the brightness of his eyes, and succeeded only after the hero had fallen asleep. That the annotator was correct in citing German authority for the slaying of Sigurth in the forest is shown by the <hi>Nibelungenlied</hi> and the <hi>Thithrekssaga</hi>. The &#8220;old&#8221; Guthrun lay is unquestionably <hi>Guthrunarkvitha II</hi>.

Unlike the poems dealing with the earlier part of the Sigurth cycle, the so-called <hi>Reginsmol</hi>, <hi>Fafnismol</hi>, and <hi>Sigrdrifumol</hi>, it is a clear and distinct unit, apparently complete and with few and minor interpolations. It is also one of the finest poems in the entire collection, with an extraordinary emotional intensity and dramatic force. None of its stanzas are quoted elsewhere, and it is altogether probable that the compilers of the <hi>Volsungasaga</hi> were unfamiliar with it, for they do not mention the sister and daughter of Gjuki who appear in this poem, or Herborg, &#8220;queen of the Huns&#8221; (stanza 6).
</p><p>The lament of Guthrun (Kriemhild) is almost certainly among the oldest parts of the story. The lament was one of the earliest forms of poetry to develop among the Germanic peoples, and I suspect, though the matter is not susceptible of proof, that the lament of Sigurth&#8217;s wife had assumed lyric form as early as the seventh century, and reached the North in that shape rather than in prose tradition (cf. <hi>Guthrunarkvitha II</hi>, introductory note). We find traces of it in the seventeenth Aventiure of the <hi>Nibelungenlied</hi>, and in the poems of the <hi>Edda</hi> it dominates every appearance of Guthrun. The two first Guthrun lays (I and II) are both laments, one for Sigurth&#8217;s death and the other including both that and the lament over the slaying of her brothers; the lament theme is apparent in the third Guthrun lay and in the <hi>Guthrunarhvot</hi>.
</p><p>In their present forms the second Guthrun lay is undoubtedly older than the first; in the prose following the <hi>Brot</hi> the annotator refers to the &#8220;old&#8221; Guthrun lay in terms which can apply only to the second one in the collection. The shorter and &#8220;first&#8221; lay, therefore, can scarcely have been composed much before the year 1000, and may be somewhat later. The poet appears to have known and made use of the older lament; stanza 17, for example, is a close parallel to stanza 2 of the earlier poem; but whatever material he used he fitted into a definite poetic scheme of his <pb id="pb412" n="412" facs="f:446"/>own. And while this particular poem is, as critics have generally agreed, one of the latest of the collection, it probably represents one of the earliest parts of the entire Sigurth cycle to take on verse form.
</p><p><hi>Guthrunarkvitha I</hi>, so far as the narrative underlying it is concerned, shows very little northern addition to the basic German tradition. Brynhild appears only as Guthrun&#8217;s enemy and the cause of Sigurth&#8217;s death; the three women who attempt to comfort Guthrun, though unknown to the southern stories, seem to have been rather distinct creations of the poet&#8217;s than traditional additions to the legend. Regarding the relations of the various elements in the Sigurth cycle, cf. introductory note to <hi>Gripisspo</hi>.</p></div2><div2 type="Section"><p id="prose2.11">Guthrun sat by the dead Sigurth; she did not weep as other women, but her heart was near to bursting with grief.

</p><p id="n2.11.24"><ab type="parNum"><ref target="lg2.11.24">24</ref>.</ab> The stanza is obviously in bad shape; perhaps it represents two separate stanzas, or perhaps three of the lines are later additions. <hi>Atli</hi>: Brynhild here blames her brother, following the frequent custom of transferring the responsibility for a murder (cf. <hi>Helgakvitha Hundingsbana II</hi>, 33), because he compelled her to marry Gunnar against her will, an idea which the poet seems to have gained from <hi>Sigurtharkvitha en skamma</hi>, 32&#8211;39. These stanzas represent an entirely different version of the story, wherein Atli, attacked by Gunnar and Sigurth, buys them off by giving Gunnar his sister, Brynhild, as wife. He seems to have induced the latter to marry Gunnar by falsely telling her that Gunnar was Sigurth (a rationalistic explanation of the interchange of forms described in the <hi>Volsungasaga</hi> and <hi>Gripisspo</hi>, 37&#8211;39). In the present stanza Atli is made to do this out of desire for Sigurth&#8217;s treasure. <hi>Hunnish race</hi>: this may be <pb id="pb419a" n="419" facs="f:453"/>merely an error (neither Gunnar nor Sigurth could properly have been connected in any way with Atli and his Huns), based on <hi>Sigurtharkvitha en skamma</hi>, wherein Sigurth appears more than once as the &#8220;Hunnish king.&#8221; The North was very much in the dark as to the differences between Germans, Burgundians, Franks, Goths, and Huns, and used the words without much discrimination. On the other hand, it may refer to Sigurth&#8217;s appearance when, adorned with gold, he came with Gunnar to besiege Atli, in the alternative version of the story just cited (cf. <hi>Sigurtharkvitha en skamma</hi>, 36). <hi>Flame of the snake&#8217;s bed</hi>: gold, so called because serpents and dragons were the traditional guardians of treasure, on which they lay.

The discrepancy between this reference and the obvious length of the poem has led to many conjectures, but the explanation seems to be that the &#8220;long&#8221; Sigurth lay, of which the <hi>Brot</hi> is presumably a part, was materially longer even than this poem. The efforts to reduce the &#8220;short&#8221; Sigurth lay to dimensions which would justify the appellation in comparison with other poems in the collection, either by separating it into two poems or by the rejection of many stanzas as interpolations, have been utterly inconclusive.
</p><p>Although there are probably several interpolated passages, and indications of omissions are not lacking, the poem as we now have it seems to be a distinct and coherent unit. From the narrative point of view it leaves a good deal to be desired, for the reason that the poet&#8217;s object was by no means to tell a story, with which his hearers were quite familiar, but to use the narrative simply as the background for vivid and powerful characterization. The lyric element, as Mogk points out, overshadows the epic throughout, and the fact that there are frequent confusions of narrative tradition does not trouble the poet at all.
</p><p>The material on which the poem was based seems to have existed in both prose and verse form; the poet was almost certainly familiar with some of the other poems in the Eddic collection, with poems which have since been lost, and with the narrative prose traditions which never fully assumed verse form. The fact that he seems to have known and used the <hi>Oddrunargratr</hi>, which can hardly have been composed before 1050, and that in any case he introduces the figure of Oddrun, a relatively late addition to the story, dates the poem as late as the end of the eleventh century, or even the first half of the twelfth. There has been much discussion as to where it was composed, the debate centering chiefly on the reference to glaciers (stanza 8). There is something to be said in favor of Greenland <pb id="pb421" n="421" facs="f:455"/>as the original home of the poem (cf. introductory note to <hi>Atlakvitha</hi>), but the arguments for Iceland are even stronger; Norway in this case is practically out of the question.
</p><p>The narrative features of the poem are based on the German rather than the Norse elements of the story (cf. introductory note to <hi>Gripisspo</hi>), but the poet has taken whatever material he wanted without much discrimination as to its source. By the year 1100 the story of Sigurth, with its allied legends, existed throughout the North in many and varied forms, and the poem shows traces of variants of the main story which do not appear elsewhere.</p></div2><div2 type="Section"><lg id="lg2.12.1" type="Verse"><l><ab type="verseNum"><ref target="n2.12.1">1</ref>.</ab> Of old did Sigurth &#160;&#160;|&#160;&#160; Gjuki seek,

Line 3 may well be an interpolation; both lines 4 and 5 have also been questioned, and some editions combine line 5 with lines 1&#8211;3 of stanza 5. <hi>Hunnish king</hi>: Sigurth, who was, of course, not a king of the Huns, but was occasionally so called in the later poems owing to the lack of ethnological distinction made by the Norse poets (cf. <hi>Guthrunarkvitha I</hi>, 24 and note).
</p><p id="n2.12.5"><ab type="parNum"><ref target="lg2.12.5">5</ref>.</ab> This stanza may refer, as Gering thinks, merely to the fact that Brynhild lived happy and unsuspecting as Gunnar&#8217;s wife until the fatal quarrel with Guthrun (cf. <hi>Gripisspo</hi>, 45 and note) revealed to her the deceit whereby she had been won, or it may refer to the version of the story which appears in stanzas 32&#8211;39, wherein Brynhild lived happily with Atli, her brother, until he was attacked by Gunnar and Sigurth, and was compelled to give his sister to Gunnar, winning her consent thereto by representing <pb id="pb423a" n="423" facs="f:457"/>Gunnar as Sigurth, her chosen hero (cf. <hi>Guthrunarkvitha I</hi>, 24 and note).

</p><p id="n2.12.6"><ab type="parNum"><ref target="lg2.12.6">6</ref>.</ab> Brynhild has now discovered the deceit that has been practised on her. That she had loved Sigurth from the outset (cf. stanza 40) fits well with the version of the story wherein Sigurth meets her before he comes to Gunnar&#8217;s home (the version not used in this poem), or the one outlined in the note on stanza 5, but does not accord with the story of Sigurth&#8217;s first meeting Brynhild in Gunnar&#8217;s form&#8212;an added reason for believing that the poet in stanzas 5&#8211;6 had in mind the story represented by stanzas 32&#8211;39. <hi>The hero</hi>: the manuscript originally had the phrase thus, then corrected it to &#8220;though I die,&#8221; and finally crossed out the correction.

</p><p id="n2.12.16"><ab type="parNum"><ref target="lg2.12.16">16</ref>.</ab> Cf. note on stanza 14. After thus adding lines 4&#8211;5 of <pb id="pb426a" n="426" facs="f:460"/>stanza 14 at the beginning of stanza 16, Gering marks line 4 as probably spurious; others reject both lines 3 and 4 as mere repetitions. <hi>Rhine</hi>: the Rhine, the sands of which traditionally contained gold, was apparently the original home of the treasure of the Nibelungs, converted in the North to Andvari&#8217;s treasure (cf. <hi>Reginsmol</hi>, 1&#8211;9). That greed for Sigurth&#8217;s wealth was one of the motives for his slaying is indicated likewise in <hi>Guthrunarkvitha I</hi>, 20, and in the German versions of the story.

But it may be that the poet had in mind a tradition which, as in the <hi>Thithrekssaga</hi>, gave Gjuki a fourth son, in which case the &#8220;four&#8221; refers only to the four Gjukungs. <hi>Hunnish hero</hi>: Sigurth; cf. stanza 4 and note.

The name is the northern form of Gundomar; a prince of this name is mentioned in the <hi>Lex Burgundionum</hi>, apparently as a brother of Gundahari (Gundicarius).

</p><p id="n2.12.32"><ab type="parNum"><ref target="lg2.12.32">32</ref>.</ab> This stanza, which all editors have accepted as an integral part of the poem, apparently refers to the same story represented by stanzas 37&#8211;39, which most editors have (I believe mistakenly) marked as interpolated. As is pointed out in the notes on stanzas 3, 5, 6 and 10, the poet throughout seems to have accepted the version of the story wherein Gunnar and Sigurth besiege Atli, and are bought off by the gift of Atli&#8217;s sister, Brynhild, to Gunnar as wife, her consent being won by Atli&#8217;s representation that Gunnar is Sigurth (cf. also <hi>Guthrunarkvitha I</hi>, 24 and note).

Line 4, as virtually a repetition of line 3, has generally been marked as spurious. In this version of the winning of Brynhild it appears that Atli pointed out Sigurth as Gunnar, and Brynhild promptly fell in love with the hero whom, as he rode on <hi>Grani</hi> and was decked with some of the spoils taken from Fafnir, she recognized as the dragon&#8217;s slayer. Thus no change of form between Sigurth and Gunnar was necessary. The oath to marry Gunnar had to be carried out even after Brynhild had discovered the deception.
</p><p id="n2.12.37"><ab type="parNum"><ref target="lg2.12.37">37</ref>.</ab> Most editors mark stanzas 37&#8211;39 as interpolated, but cf. note on stanza 32. Stanza 37 has been variously emended. Lines 4 and 6 look like interpolated repetitions, but many editors make <pb id="pb432a" n="432" facs="f:466"/>two stanzas, following the manuscript in beginning a new stanza with line 4. After line 1 Grundtvig adds: &#8220;Son of Buthli, &#160;&#160;|&#160;&#160; and brother of mine.&#8221; After line 6 Bugge adds: &#8220;Not thou was it, Gunnar, &#160;&#160;|&#160;&#160; who Grani rode, / Though thou my brother &#160;&#160;|&#160;&#160; with rings didst buy.&#8221; Regarding Brynhild&#8217;s wealth cf. stanza 10 and note.

Brynhild&#8217;s statement in lines 1&#8211;2 seems to refer to the episode, not here mentioned but told in detail in the <hi>Volsungasaga</hi>, of Sigurth&#8217;s effort to repair the wrong that has been done her by himself giving up Guthrun in her favor, an offer which she refuses. The lacuna here suggested, which is not indicated in the manuscript, may be simply a single line (line 1) or a stanza or more. After line 2 there is almost certainly a gap of at least one stanza, and possibly more, in which Brynhild states her determination to die.

I have followed the manuscript except in transposing line 4 of stanza 43 to this position from the place it holds in the manuscript after line 4 of stanza 44. All the other arrangements involve the rejection of two or more lines as spurious and the assumption of various gaps. Gering and Sijmons both arrange the lines thus: 42, 1&#8211;2; two-line gap; 43, 3 <pb id="pb434a" n="434" facs="f:468"/>(marked probably spurious); 44, 1&#8211;4; 43&#8211;4 (marked probably spurious); 42, 3&#8211;4; 43, 1&#8211;2.

</p><p id="n2.12.46"><ab type="parNum"><ref target="lg2.12.46">46</ref>.</ab> The manuscript marks line 3 as beginning a stanza; some <pb id="pb435a" n="435" facs="f:469"/>editions treat lines 1&#8211;2 as a separate stanza, and combine lines 3&#8211;4 with lines 1&#8211;2 of stanza 47. <hi>Jewel-bearer</hi> (literally &#8220;land of jewels&#8221;): woman, here Brynhild. <hi>Bond-women</hi>, etc.: in stanza 69 we learn that five female slaves and eight serfs were killed to be burned on the funeral pyre, and thus to follow Sigurth in death.

The name means &#8220;Swan-Maiden-Warrior,&#8221; applying to just such mixtures of swan-maiden and Valkyrie as appear in the <hi>V&#246;lundarkvitha</hi>. Originally part of a separate tradition, Svanhild appears first to have been incorporated in the Jormunrek (Ermanarich) story as the unhappy wife of that monarch, and much later to have been identified as the daughter of Sigurth and Guthrun, thus linking the two sets of legends.

The entire poem, with the exception of stanza 6, is likewise quoted in the <hi>Nornageststhattr</hi>. Outside of one stanza (No. 11), which is a fairly obvious interpolation, the poem possesses an extraordinary degree of dramatic unity, and, certain pedantic commentators notwithstanding, it is one of the most vivid and powerful in the whole collection. None the less, it has been extensively argued that parts of it belonged originally to the so-called <hi>Sigrdrifumol</hi>. That it stands in close relation to this poem is evident enough, but it is difficult to believe that such a masterpiece of dramatic poetry was ever the result of mere compilation. It seems more reasonable to regard the <hi>Helreith</hi>, with the exception of stanza 11 and allowing for the loss of two lines from stanza 6, as a complete and carefully constructed unit, based undoubtedly on older poems, but none the less an artistic creation in itself.
</p><p>The poem is generally dated as late as the eleventh century, and the concluding stanza betrays Christian influence almost unmistakably. It shows the confusion of traditions manifest in all the later poems; for example, Brynhild is here not only a Valkyrie but also a swan-maiden. Only three stanzas have any reference to the Guthrun-Gunnar part of the story; otherwise the poem is concerned solely with the episode of Sigurth&#8217;s finding the sleeping Valkyrie.

To some extent these links were based on traditions existing outside of the lays themselves, but in the main the material was gathered from the contents of the poems. The short prose passage entitled <hi>Drap Niflunga</hi>, which in the <hi lang="la" xml:lang="la">Codex Regius</hi> immediately follows the <hi>Helreith Brynhildar</hi>, is just such a narrative link, and scarcely deserves a special heading, but as nearly all editions separate it from the preceding and following poems, I have followed their example.
</p><p>With Sigurth and Brynhild both dead, the story turns to the slaying of the sons of Gjuki by Atli, Guthrun&#8217;s second husband, and to a few subsequent incidents, mostly late incorporations from other narrative cycles, including the tragic death of Svanhild, daughter of Sigurth and Guthrun and wife of Jormunrek (Ermanarich), and the exploits of Hamther, son of Guthrun and her third husband, Jonak. These stories are told, or outlined, in the two Atli lays, the second and third Guthrun lays, the <hi>Oddrunargratr</hi>, the <hi>Guthrunarhvot</hi>, and the <hi>Hamthesmol</hi>. Had the compiler seen fit to put the Atli lays immediately after the <hi>Helreith Brynhildar</hi>, he would have needed only a very brief transitional note to make the course of the story clear, but as the second Guthrun lay, the next poem in the collection, is a lament following the death of Guthrun&#8217;s brothers, some sort of a narrative bridge was manifestly needed.
</p><p><hi>Drap Niflunga</hi> is based entirely on the poems which follow it in the collection, with no use of extraneous material. The part of the story which it summarizes belongs to the semi-historical Burgundian tradition (cf. introductory note to <hi>Gripisspo</hi>), in many respects parallel to the familiar narrative of the <hi>Nibelungenlied</hi>, and, except in minor details, showing few essentially Northern additions. Sigurth is scarcely mentioned, and the outstanding episode is the slaying of Gunnar and Hogni, following their journey to Atli&#8217;s home.</p></div2><div2 type="Section"><pb id="pb448" n="448" facs="f:482"/><p id="prose2.14">Gunnar and Hogni then took all the gold that Fafnir had had. There was strife between the Gjukungs and Atli, for he held the Gjukungs guilty of Brynhild&#8217;s death. It was agreed that they should give him Guthrun as wife, and they gave her a draught of forgetfulness to drink before she would consent to be wedded to Atli. The sons of Atli were Erp and Eitil, and Svanhild was the daughter of Sigurth and Guthrun. King Atli invited Gunnar and Hogni to come to him, and sent as messenger Vingi or Knefr&#246;th. Guthrun was aware of treachery, and sent with him a message in runes that they should not come, and as a token she sent to Hogni the ring Andvaranaut and tied a wolf&#8217;s hair in it. Gunnar had sought Oddrun, Atli&#8217;s sister, for his wife, but had her not; then he married Glaumvor, and Hogni&#8217;s wife was <pb id="pb449" n="449" facs="f:483"/>Kostbera; their sons were Solar and Sn&#230;var and Gjuki. And when the Gjukungs came to Atli, then Guthrun besought her sons to plead for the lives of both the Gjukungs, but they would not do it. Hogni&#8217;s heart was cut out, and Gunnar was cast into the serpent&#8217;s den. He smote on the harp and put the serpents to sleep, but an adder stung him in the liver.

The annotator has here tried, unsuccessfully, to combine the two accounts. <hi>Andvaranaut</hi>: regarding the origin of Andvari&#8217;s ring cf. <hi>Reginsmol</hi>, prose after stanzas 4 and 5 and notes; Sigurth gave the ring to Guthrun. Here again the annotator is combining two stories; in <hi>Atlakvitha</hi> (stanza 8) Guthrun sends a ring (not Andvaranaut) with a wolf&#8217;s hair; in <hi>Atlamol</hi> (stanza 4) she sends a message written <pb id="pb449a" n="449" facs="f:483"/>in runes. The messenger obscures these runes, and Kostbera, Hogni&#8217;s wife, who attempts to decipher them, is not clear as to their meaning, though she suspects danger. <hi>Oddrun</hi>: cf. <hi>Sigurtharkvitha en skamma</hi>, 57 and note. <hi>Glaumvor</hi>: almost nothing is told of Gunnar&#8217;s second wife, though she appears frequently in the <hi>Atlamol</hi>. <hi>Kostbera</hi> (or Bera), Hogni&#8217;s wife, is known only as skilled in runes. Her brother was Orkning. The sons of Hogni and Kostbera, according to the <hi>Atlamol</hi> (stanza 28), were <hi>Solar</hi> and <hi>Sn&#230;var</hi>; the third son, <hi>Gjuki</hi>, named after his grandfather, seems to be an invention of the annotator&#8217;s. <hi>Adder</hi>: according to <hi>Oddrunargratr</hi> (stanza 30) Atli&#8217;s mother assumed this form in order to complete her son&#8217;s vengeance.








<pb id="pb450" n="450" facs="f:484"/></p></div2></div1><div1 id="ch2.15" type="Introduction"><head>GUTHRUNARKVITHA II, EN FORNA</head><head type="sub"><hi>The Second, or Old, Lay of Guthrun</hi></head><div2 id="ch2.15.n" rend="introNote" type="Section"><head><hi rend="sc">Introductory Note</hi></head><p>It has already been pointed out (introductory note to <hi>Guthrunarkvitha I</hi>) that the tradition of Guthrun&#8217;s lament was known wherever the Sigurth story existed, and that this lament was probably one of the earliest parts of the legend to assume verse form. Whether it reached the North as verse cannot, of course, be determined, but it is at least possible that this was the case, and in any event it is clear that by the tenth and eleventh centuries there were a number of Norse poems with Guthrun&#8217;s lament as the central theme. Two of these are included in the Eddic collection, the second one being unquestionably much the older. It is evidently the poem referred to by the annotator in the prose note following the <hi>Brot</hi> as &#8220;the old Guthrun lay,&#8221; and its character and state of preservation have combined to lead most commentators to date it as early as the first half of the tenth century, whereas <hi>Guthrunarkvitha I</hi> belongs a hundred years later.
</p><p>The poem has evidently been preserved in rather bad shape, with a number of serious omissions and some interpolations, but in just this form it lay before the compilers of the <hi>Volsungasaga</hi>, who paraphrased it faithfully, and quoted five of its stanzas. The interpolations are on the whole unimportant; the omissions, while they obscure the sense of certain passages, do not destroy the essential continuity of the poem, in which Guthrun reviews her sorrows from the death of Sigurth through the slaying of her brothers to Atli&#8217;s dreams foretelling the death of their sons. It is, indeed, the only Norse poem of the Sigurth cycle antedating the year 1000 which has come down to us in anything approaching complete form; the <hi>Reginsmol</hi>, <hi>Fafnismol</hi>, and <hi>Sigrdrifumol</hi> are all collections of fragments, only a short bit of the &#8220;long&#8221; Sigurth lay remains, and the others&#8212;<hi>Gripisspo</hi>, <hi>Guthrunarkvitha I</hi> and <hi>III</hi>, <hi>Sigurtharkvitha en skamma</hi>, <hi>Helreith Brynhildar</hi>, <hi>Oddrunargratr</hi>, <hi>Guthrunarhvot</hi>, <hi>Hamthesmol</hi>, and the two Atli lays&#8212;are all generally dated from the eleventh and even the twelfth centuries.
</p><p>An added reason for believing that <hi>Guthrunarkvitha II</hi> traces its origin back to a lament which reached the North <pb id="pb451" n="451" facs="f:485"/>from Germany in verse form is the absence of most of the characteristic Norse additions to the narrative, except in minor details. Sigurth is slain in the forest, as &#8220;German men say&#8221; (cf. <hi>Brot</hi>, concluding prose); the urging of Guthrun by her mother and brothers to become Atli&#8217;s wife, the slaying of the Gjukungs (here only intimated, for at that point something seems to have been lost), and Guthrun&#8217;s prospective revenge on Atli, all belong directly to the German tradition (cf. introductory note to <hi>Gripisspo</hi>).
</p><p>In the <hi lang="la" xml:lang="la">Codex Regius</hi> the poem is entitled simply <hi>Guthrunarkvitha</hi>; the numeral has been added in nearly all editions to distinguish this poem from the other two Guthrun lays, and the phrase &#8220;the old&#8221; is borrowed from the annotator&#8217;s comment in the prose note at the end of the <hi>Brot</hi>.</p></div2><div2 type="Section"><p id="prose2.15">King Thjothrek was with Atli, and had lost most of his men.

The German tradition early accepted the anachronism of bringing together Attila (Etzel, Atli), who died in 453, and Theoderich, who was born about 455, and adding thereto Ermanarich (Jormunrek), king of the Goths, who died about 376. Ermanarich, in German tradition, replaced Theoderich&#8217;s actual enemy, Odovakar, and it was in battle with Jormunrek (i.e., Odovakar) that Thjothrek is here said to have lost most of his men. The annotator found the material for this note in <hi>Guthrunarkvitha III</hi>, in which Guthrun is accused of having Thjothrek as her lover. At the time when <hi>Guthrunarkvitha II</hi> <pb id="pb452a" n="452" facs="f:486"/>was composed (early tenth century) it is probable that the story of Theoderich had not reached the North at all, and the annotator is consequently wrong in giving the poem its setting.

Line 2 <pb id="pb456a" n="456" facs="f:490"/>has been filled out in various ways. The <hi>Volsungasaga</hi> paraphrase indicates that these two lines are the remains of a full stanza, the prose passage running: &#8220;Now Guthrun was somewhat comforted of her sorrows. Then Grimhild learned where Guthrun was now dwelling.&#8221; The first two lines may be the ones missing. <hi>Gothic</hi>: the term &#8220;Goth&#8221; was used in the North without much discrimination to apply to all south-Germanic peoples.

Some commentators assume, as the <hi>Volsungasaga</hi> does, that these messengers went with the Gjukungs to Denmark in search of Guthrun, but it seems more likely that a transitional stanza has dropped out after stanza 19, and that Guthrun received Atli&#8217;s emissaries in her brothers&#8217; home. <hi>Long-beards</hi>: the word may actually mean Langobards or Lombards, but, if it does, it is presumably without any specific significance here. Certainly the names in the interpolated two lines do not fit either Lombards or Huns, for Valdar is identified as a Dane, and Jarizleif and Jarizskar are apparently Slavic.

I suspect that line 4 is wrong, and should read: &#8220;Ere he himself (Atli) &#160;&#160;|&#160;&#160; to speak began.&#8221; Certainly stanzas 26&#8211;27 <pb id="pb459a" n="459" facs="f:493"/>fit Atli much better than they do Grimhild, and there is nothing unreasonable in Atli&#8217;s having come in person, along with his tributary kings, to seek Guthrun&#8217;s hand. However, the &#8220;three kings&#8221; may not be Atli&#8217;s followers at all, but Gunnar, Hogni, and the unnamed third brother possibly referred to in <hi>Sigurtharkvitha en skamma</hi>, 18.

In lines 3&#8211;4 Guthrun foretells what will (and actually does) happen if she is forced to become Atli&#8217;s wife.

</p><p id="n2.15.37"><ab type="parNum"><ref target="lg2.15.37">37</ref>.</ab> After these two lines there appears to be a considerable gap, the lost stanzas giving Guthrun&#8217;s story of the slaying of her brothers. It is possible that stanzas 38&#8211;45 came originally from another poem, dealing with Atli&#8217;s dream, and were here substituted for the original conclusion of Guthrun&#8217;s lament. Many editions combine stanzas 37 and 38, or combine stanza 38 (the manuscript marks line 1 as beginning a stanza) with lines 1&#8211;2 of stanza 39.
</p><p id="n2.15.39"><ab type="parNum"><ref target="lg2.15.39">39</ref>.</ab> The manuscript indicates line 3 as the beginning of a stanza. The manuscript and most editions do not indicate the speakers in this and the following stanzas.

</p><p id="n2.15.41"><ab type="parNum"><ref target="lg2.15.41">41</ref>.</ab> In stanzas 41&#8211;43 Atli&#8217;s dreams forecast the death of his two sons, whose flesh Guthrun gives him to eat (cf. <hi>Atlakvitha</hi>, 39, and <hi>Atlamol</hi>, 78).
</p><p id="n2.15.44"><ab type="parNum"><ref target="lg2.15.44">44</ref>.</ab> This stanza is evidently Guthrun&#8217;s intentionally cryptic <pb id="pb464a" n="464" facs="f:498"/>interpretation of Atli&#8217;s dreams, but the meaning of the original is more than doubtful. The word here rendered &#8220;sacrifice&#8221; may mean &#8220;sea-catch,&#8221; and the one rendered &#8220;beasts&#8221; may mean &#8220;whales.&#8221; None of the attempted emendations have rendered the stanza really intelligible, but it appears to mean that Atli will soon make a sacrifice of beasts at night, and give their bodies to the people. Guthrun of course has in mind the slaying of his two sons.
</p><p id="n2.15.45"><ab type="parNum"><ref target="lg2.15.45">45</ref>.</ab> With these two lines the poem abruptly ends; some editors assign the speech to Atli (I think rightly), others to Guthrun. Ettm&#252;ller combines the lines with stanza 38. Whether stanzas 38&#8211;45 originally belonged to Guthrun&#8217;s lament, or were interpolated here in place of the lost conclusion of that poem from another one dealing with Atli&#8217;s dreams (cf. note on stanza 37), it is clear that the end has been lost.

It is neither quoted nor paraphrased in the <hi>Volsungasaga</hi>, the compilers of which appear not to have known the story with which it deals. The poem as we have it is evidently complete and free from serious interpolations. It can safely be dated from the first half of the eleventh century, for the ordeal by boiling water, with which it is chiefly concerned, was first introduced into Norway by St. Olaf, who died in 1030, and the poem speaks of it in stanza 7 as still of foreign origin.
</p><p>The material for the poem evidently came from North Germany, but there is little indication that the poet was working on the basis of a narrative legend already fully formed. The story of the wife accused of faithlessness who proves her innocence by the test of boiling water had long been current in Germany, as elsewhere, and had attached itself to various women of legendary fame, but not except in this poem, so far as we can judge, to Guthrun (Kriemhild). The introduction of Thjothrek (Theoderich, Dietrich, Thithrek) is another indication of relative lateness, for the legends of Theoderich do not appear to have reached the North materially before the year 1000. On the anachronism of bringing Thjothrek to Atli&#8217;s court cf. <hi>Guthrunarkvitha II</hi>, introductory prose, note, in which the development of the Theoderich tradition in its relation to that of Atli is briefly outlined.
</p><p><hi>Guthrunarkvitha III</hi> is, then, little more than a dramatic German story made into a narrative lay by a Norse poet, with the names of Guthrun, Atli, Thjothrek, and Herkja incorporated for the sake of greater effectiveness. Its story probably nowhere formed a part of the living tradition of Sigurth and Atli, but the poem has so little distinctively Norse coloring that it may possibly have been based on a story or even a poem which its composer heard in Germany or from the lips of a German narrator.</p></div2><div2 type="Section"><pb id="pb466" n="466" facs="f:500"/><p id="prose2.16">Herkja was the name of a serving-woman of Atli&#8217;s; she had been his concubine.

The <hi>Volsungasaga</hi> says nothing of the story on which it is based, and mentions Oddrun only once, in the course of its paraphrase of Brynhild&#8217;s prophecy from the &#8220;short&#8221; Sigurth lay. That the poem comes from the eleventh century is generally agreed; prior to the year 1000 there is no trace of the figure of Oddrun, Atli&#8217;s sister, and yet the <hi>Oddrunargratr</hi> is almost certainly older than the &#8220;short&#8221; Sigurth lay, so that the last half of the eleventh century seems to be a fairly safe guess.
</p><p>Where or how the figure of Oddrun entered the Sigurth-Atli cycle is uncertain. She does not appear in any of the extant German versions, and it is generally assumed that she was a creation of the North, though the poet refers to &#8220;old tales&#8221; concerning her. She does not directly affect the course of the story at all, though the poet has used effectively the episode of Gunnar&#8217;s death, with the implication that Atli&#8217;s vengeance on Gunnar and Hogni was due, at least in part, to his discovery of Gunnar&#8217;s love affair with Oddrun. The material which forms the background of Oddrun&#8217;s story belongs wholly to the German part of the legend (cf. introductory note to <hi>Gripisspo</hi>), and is paralleled with considerable closeness in the <hi>Nibelungenlied</hi>; only Oddrun herself and the subsidiary figures of Borgny and Vilmund are Northern additions. The geography, on the other hand, is so utterly chaotic as to indicate that the original localization of the Atli story had lost all trace of significance by the time this poem was composed.
</p><p>In the manuscript the poem, or rather the brief introductory prose note, bears the heading &#8220;Of Borgny and Oddrun,&#8221; but nearly all editions, following late paper manuscripts, have given the poem the title it bears here. Outside of a few apparently defective stanzas, and some confusing transpositions, the poem has clearly been preserved in good condition, and the beginning and end are definitely marked.</p></div2><div2 type="Section"><pb id="pb470" n="470" facs="f:504"/><p id="prose2.17">Heithrek was the name of a king, whose daughter was called Borgny.

The poems are not preserved or quoted in any other old manuscript, but they were extensively used by the compilers of the <hi>Volsungasaga</hi>. In the manuscript superscription to each of these poems appears the word &#8220;Greenland,&#8221; which has given rise to a large amount of argument. The scribe was by no means infallible, and in this case his statement proves no more than that in the period round 1300 there was a tradition that these two poems originated in the Greenland settlement.
</p><p>The two Atli poems deal with substantially the same material: the visit of the sons of Gjuki to Atli&#8217;s court, their deaths, and the subsequent revenge of their sister, Guthrun, Atli&#8217;s wife, on her husband. The shorter of the two, the <hi>Atlakvitha</hi>, tells the story with little elaboration; the <hi>Atlamol</hi>, with about the same narrative basis, adds many details, some of them apparently of the poet&#8217;s invention, and with a romantic, not to say sentimental, quality quite lacking in the <hi>Atlakvitha</hi>. Both poems are sharply distinguished from the rest of the collection by their metrical form, which is the Malahattr (used irregularly also in the <hi>Harbarthsljoth</hi>), employed consistently and smoothly in the <hi>Atlamol</hi>, and with a considerable mixture of what appear to be Fornyrthislag lines (cf. Introduction) in the <hi>Atlakvitha</hi>.
</p><p>It is altogether probable that both poems belong to the eleventh century, the shorter <hi>Atlakvitha</hi> being generally dated from the first quarter thereof, and the longer <hi>Atlamol</hi> some fifty years or more later. In each case the poet was apparently a Christian; in the <hi>Atlamol</hi> (stanza 82) Guthrun expresses her readiness to die and &#8220;go into another light,&#8221; and in the <hi>Atlakvitha</hi> there is frequent use of mythological names (e.g., Valhall, Hlithskjolf) with an evident lack of understanding of their relation to the older gods. These facts fit the theory of a Greenland origin exceedingly well, for the Greenland settlement grew rapidly after the first explorations of Eirik the Red, which were in 982&#8211;985, and its most flourishing period was in the eleventh century. The internal evidence, particularly in the case of the <hi>Atlamol</hi>, points <pb id="pb481" n="481" facs="f:515"/>likewise to an origin remote from Iceland, Norway, and the &#8220;Western Isles&#8221;; and the two poems are sufficiently alike so that, despite the efforts of Finnur Jonsson and others to separate them, assigning one to Greenland and the other to Norway or elsewhere, it seems probable that the manuscript statement is correct in both instances, and that the two Atli poems did actually originate in Greenland. An interesting account of this Greenland settlement is given in William Hovgaard&#8217;s <hi>Voyages of the Norsemen to America</hi>, published by the American-Scandinavian Foundation in 1914, and an extraordinarily vivid picture of the sufferings of the early settlers appears in Maurice Hewlett&#8217;s <hi>Thorgils</hi>, taken from the <hi>Floamannasaga</hi>.
</p><p>From the standpoint of narrative material there is little that is distinctively Norse in either the <hi>Atlakvitha</hi> or the <hi>Atlamol</hi>. The story is the one outlined in the prose <hi>Drap Niflunga</hi> (largely based on these two poems), representing almost exclusively the southern blending of the Attila and Burgundian legends (cf. introductory note to <hi>Gripisspo</hi>). In the <hi>Atlakvitha</hi>, indeed, the word &#8220;Burgundians&#8221; is actually used. Brynhild is not mentioned in either poem; Sigurth&#8217;s name appears but once, in the <hi>Atlamol</hi>. Thus the material goes directly back to its South-Germanic origins, with little of the Northern making-over which resulted in such extensive changes in most parts of the Sigurth story. The general atmosphere, on the other hand, particularly in the <hi>Atlamol</hi>, is essentially Norse.
</p><p>As has been said, the <hi>Atlakvitha</hi> is metrically in a chaotic state, the normal Malahattr lines being frequently interspersed with lines and even stanzas which apparently are of the older Fornyrthislag type. How much of this confusion is due to faulty transmission is uncertain, but it has been suggested that the composer of the <hi>Atlakvitha</hi> made over in Malahattr an older Atli poem in Fornyrthislag, and this suggestion has much to recommend it. That he worked on the basis of an older poem is, indeed, almost certain, for in oral prose tradition a far larger number of distinctively Norse traits would unquestionably have crept in than are found in the material of the <hi>Atlakvitha</hi>. As for the <hi>Atlamol</hi>, here again the poet seems to have used an older poem as his basis, possibly the <hi>Atlakvitha</hi> itself, although in that case he must have had other material as well, for there are frequent divergences in such matters as proper names.
</p><p>The translation of the <hi>Atlakvitha</hi> is rendered peculiarly difficult <pb id="pb482" n="482" facs="f:516"/>by the irregularity of the metre, by the evident faultiness of the transmission, and above all by the exceptionally large number of words found nowhere else in Old Norse, involving much guesswork as to their meanings. The notes do not attempt to indicate all the varying suggestions made by editors and commentators as to the reconstruction of defective stanzas and the probable meanings of obscure passages; in cases which are purely or largely guesswork the notes merely point out the uncertainty without cataloguing the proposed solutions.</p></div2><div2 type="Section"><p id="prose2.18">Guthrun, Gjuki&#8217;s daughter, avenged her brothers, as has become well known.

</p><p id="n2.18.3"><ab type="parNum"><ref target="lg2.18.3">3</ref>.</ab> <hi>Myrkwood the secret</hi> (the adjective is literally &#8220;unknown&#8221;): the forest which divided Atli&#8217;s realm from that of the Gjukungs; cf. <hi>Oddrunargratr</hi>, 23 and note. <hi>Around the hearth</hi>: the adjective is the same one which is applied to &#8220;benches&#8221; in stanza 1 (cf. note); it may be an error here, or it may possibly have the force of &#8220;of your followers,&#8221; i.e., Gunnar is to arm the men of his household (those who are round his hearth) for the journey.
</p><p id="n2.18.4"><ab type="parNum"><ref target="lg2.18.4">4</ref>.</ab> <hi>Slaves</hi>, etc.: some editions have &#8220;swords in plenty.&#8221; <hi>Scarlet</hi>: the word apparently means &#8220;slaughter-red,&#8221; &#8220;blood-red,&#8221; but it may mean something entirely different.
<pb id="pb484a" n="484" facs="f:518"/></p><p id="n2.18.5"><ab type="parNum"><ref target="lg2.18.5">5</ref>.</ab> <hi>Gnitaheith</hi>: here the dragon Fafnir had his lair (cf. <hi>Gripisspo</hi>, 11). Sigurth doubtless owned it after Fafnir&#8217;s death, and the Gjukungs after they had killed Sigurth. Possibly they had given it to Atli in recompense for the death of his sister, Brynhild, and he now offered to restore it to them, or&#8212;as seems more likely&#8212;the poet was not very clear about its ownership himself. <hi>Stems</hi>: i.e., the gilded stems of ships, carved like dragons,&#8212;an evident northern touch, if the word is correct, which is by no means certain. <hi>Danp</hi>: this name was early applied to a mythical Danish king (cf. <hi>Rigsthula</hi>, 49 and note), but it may have been fabricated by error out of the word &#8220;Danparsta&#254;ir&#8221; (the phrase here used is &#8220;<foreign lang="non" xml:lang="non">sta&#254;i Danpar</foreign>&#8221;), used in the <hi>Hervararsaga</hi> of a field of battle between the Goths and the Huns, and quite possibly referring to the region of the Dnieper. The name seems to have clung to the Atli tradition long after it had lost all definite significance. <hi>Myrkwood</hi>: cf. note on stanza 3.
<pb id="pb485a" n="485" facs="f:519"/></p><p id="n2.18.7"><ab type="parNum"><ref target="lg2.18.7">7</ref>.</ab> The stanza is clearly in bad shape; the manuscript indicates line 5 as beginning a new stanza. In line 5 the manuscript has &#8220;and shield&#8221; after &#8220;helm.&#8221; <hi>Kjar</hi>: Gering ingeniously identifies this Kjar with Kjar the father of Olrun, mentioned in the <hi>V&#246;lundarkvitha</hi>, introductory prose and stanza 2, on the basis of a genealogy in the <hi>Flateyjarbok</hi>, in which Authi, the grandfather of Kjar (by no means certainly the same man) and Buthli, father of Atli, are mentioned as making a raiding voyage together. This identification, however, rests on slight evidence.
</p><p id="n2.18.8"><ab type="parNum"><ref target="lg2.18.8">8</ref>.</ab> The manuscript does not name the speaker. One editor gives the first sentence to Gunnar. <hi>She</hi>, etc.: Guthrun, seeking to warn her brothers of Atli&#8217;s treachery, sends them a ring with a wolf&#8217;s hair as a sign of danger; in the <hi>Atlamol</hi> (stanza 4) she sends a message written in runes; cf. <hi>Drap Niflunga</hi>. <hi>Heath-dweller</hi>: wolf.
<pb id="pb486a" n="486" facs="f:520"/></p><p id="n2.18.9"><ab type="parNum"><ref target="lg2.18.9">9</ref>.</ab> In line 1 the manuscript has &#8220;His comrades did not urge Gunnar,&#8221; but the name, involving a metrical error, seems to have been inserted through a scribal blunder.
</p><p id="n2.18.10"><ab type="parNum"><ref target="lg2.18.10">10</ref>.</ab> The manuscript indicates no lacuna, but probably two lines have dropped out, for the <hi>Volsungasaga</hi> paraphrase runs: &#8220;Give us to drink in great cups, for it may well be that this shall be our last feast.&#8221; <hi>Fjornir</hi>: Gunnar&#8217;s cup-bearer.
</p><p id="n2.18.11"><ab type="parNum"><ref target="lg2.18.11">11</ref>.</ab> Bugge thinks this stanza is spoken by Gunnar&#8217;s terrified followers; Grundtvig assigns it to Hogni. Apparently, however, Gunnar means that if he and his men are not valiant enough to make the journey and return safely, it matters little what may happen to them. <hi>Niflungs</hi>: regarding the application of this name to Gunnar&#8217;s Burgundians cf. <hi>Brot</hi>, 17 and note. <hi>Bears</hi>: these &#8220;black&#8221; bears have been used as arguments against the Greenland origin of the poem. <hi>And make glad the dogs</hi>: i.e., by giving them corpses to eat, but the phrase in the original is more than doubtful.
<pb id="pb487a" n="487" facs="f:521"/></p><p id="n2.18.12"><ab type="parNum"><ref target="lg2.18.12">12</ref>.</ab> Some editions in line 2 read &#8220;home of the Niflungs&#8221; instead of &#8220;their home,&#8221; and others &#8220;home of the Huns,&#8221; the manuscript reading being &#8220;home of the men.&#8221; <hi>Heir</hi>: the <hi>Atlamol</hi> (stanza 28) names two sons of Hogni, Sn&#230;var and Solar, both of whom make the journey with their father and are killed. The <hi>Volsungasaga</hi>, combining the two versions, says that Sn&#230;var and Solar went with their father, and implies that it was a third and still younger son who said: &#8220;Farewell, and have a good time&#8221; (thus literally).
</p><p id="n2.18.13"><ab type="parNum"><ref target="lg2.18.13">13</ref>.</ab> <hi>Myrkwood</hi>: cf. stanza 3 and note; the journey is here made by land, whereas in the <hi>Atlamol</hi> it is made partly by boat; cf. <hi>Atlamol</hi>, 34 and note. <hi>Whip-fearers</hi>: horses, but there is some uncertainty as to the word.
</p><p id="n2.18.14"><ab type="parNum"><ref target="lg2.18.14">14</ref>.</ab> In line 1 the manuscript has &#8220;land&#8221; instead of &#8220;halls,&#8221; which involves a metrical error. <hi>Watch-towers</hi>: the word used is identical with the name of Othin&#8217;s watch-tower, Hlithskjolf (cf. <hi>Grimnismol</hi>, introductory prose). <hi>Buthli</hi>: the manuscript has &#8220;Bikki,&#8221; which has led some editors to transfer this stanza to <pb id="pb488a" n="488" facs="f:522"/>the <hi>Hamthesmol</hi>, placing it between stanzas 16 and 17; it seems more likely, however, that &#8220;Bikki&#8221; was a scribal error for &#8220;Buthli.&#8221; Regarding Bikki cf. <hi>Sigurtharkvitha en skamma</hi>, 63 and note. Line 4 is apparently in Fornyrthislag.
</p><p id="n2.18.15"><ab type="parNum"><ref target="lg2.18.15">15</ref>.</ab> Line 1 in the manuscript is apparently incorrectly copied, and some editions omit &#8220;Mid weapons and lances&#8221; and assume a gap in either line 1 or line 3.
</p><p id="n2.18.17"><ab type="parNum"><ref target="lg2.18.17">17</ref>.</ab> This may be the remains of two stanzas; the manuscript marks line 5 as beginning a new stanza. Editorial conjectures are <pb id="pb489a" n="489" facs="f:523"/>numerous and varied. <hi>Household</hi>: the phrase is the same &#8220;helms round the hearth&#8221; commented on in stanza 3. Some editions insert a conjectural line after line 3. <hi>Sword-norns</hi>, etc.: the line is exceedingly obscure, and the phrase rendered &#8220;sword-norns&#8221; may mean &#8220;corpse-norns.&#8221; Apparently it refers to the warrior-women of the Huns, the &#8220;shield-maids&#8221; of line 5 and of stanza 45. Roman writers refer to the warrior-women among the early Germanic tribes, and the tradition, closely allied to that of the Valkyries, attached itself readily to the ferocious Huns. <hi>Den of snakes</hi>: concerning the manner of Gunnar&#8217;s death cf. <hi>Drap Niflunga</hi>.
</p><p id="n2.18.18"><ab type="parNum"><ref target="lg2.18.18">18</ref>.</ab> The manuscript indicates no lacuna and does not name the speaker; perhaps a line similar to line 1 of stanza 24 (or 26) should be inserted here. <hi>Rhine</hi>: Gunnar&#8217;s Burgundian home is here clearly localized. After this stanza it is probable that a passage describing the battle has been lost.
</p><p id="n2.18.19"><ab type="parNum"><ref target="lg2.18.19">19</ref>.</ab> These two lines, apparently the remains of a full stanza, <pb id="pb490a" n="490" facs="f:524"/>may belong after stanza 20. <hi>Burgundians&#8217; king</hi>: the phrase may mean &#8220;Burgundians&#8217; men,&#8221; i.e., they bound all the Burgundians who were left alive after the battle. This is the only place in the poems in which the name &#8220;Burgundian&#8221; appears; that the poet had no very clear conception of its meaning is indicated by the fact that in stanza 21 he calls Gunnar &#8220;king of the Goths.&#8221;
</p><p id="n2.18.20"><ab type="parNum"><ref target="lg2.18.20">20</ref>.</ab> Apparently a Fornyrthislag stanza, though most editions have attempted to expand the lines into Malahattr. The exploits of Hogni (Hagene), with the names of many of his victims, are told in the <hi>Nibelungenlied</hi>. <hi>The fire</hi>: in the <hi>Nibelungenlied</hi> Kriemhild has the hall set on fire, and the Burgundians fight amid the flames.

<pb id="pb499" n="499" facs="f:533"/></p></div2></div1><div1 id="ch2.19" type="Introduction"><head>ATLAMOL EN GR&#214;NLENZKU</head><head type="sub"><hi>The Greenland Ballad of Atli</hi></head><div2 id="ch2.19.n" rend="introNote" type="Section"><head><hi rend="sc">Introductory Note</hi></head><p>Many of the chief facts regarding the <hi>Atlamol</hi>, which follows the <hi>Atlakvitha</hi> in the <hi lang="la" xml:lang="la">Codex Regius</hi>, are outlined in the introductory note to the earlier Atli lay. That the superscription in the manuscript is correct, and that the poem was actually composed in Greenland, is generally accepted; the specific reference to polar bears (stanza 17), and the general color of the entire poem make this origin exceedingly likely. Most critics, again, agree in dating the poem nearer 1100 than 1050. As to its state of preservation there is some dispute, but, barring one or two possible gaps of some importance, and the usual number of passages in which the interpolation or omission of one or two lines may be suspected, the <hi>Atlamol</hi> has clearly come down to us in fairly good shape.
</p><p>Throughout the poem the epic quality of the story itself is overshadowed by the romantically sentimental tendencies of the poet, and by his desire to adapt the narrative to the understanding of his fellow-Greenlanders. The substance of the poem is the same as that of the <hi>Atlakvitha</hi>; it tells of Atli&#8217;s message to the sons of Gjuki, their journey to Atli&#8217;s home, the slaying of Hogni and Gunnar, Guthrun&#8217;s bitterness over the death of her brothers, and her bloody revenge on Atli. Thus in its bare outline the <hi>Atlamol</hi> represents simply the Frankish blending of the legends of the slaughter of the Burgundians and the death of Attila (cf. <hi>Gripisspo</hi>, introductory note). But here the resemblance ends. The poet has added characters, apparently of his own creation, for the sake of episodes which would appeal to both the men and the women of the Greenland settlement. Sea voyages take the place of journeys by land; Atli is reproached, not for cowardice in battle, but for weakness at the Thing or great council. The additions made by the poet are responsible for the <hi>Atlamol&#8217;s</hi> being the longest of all the heroic poems in the Eddic collection, and they give it a kind of emotional vividness, but it has little of the compressed intensity of the older poems. Its greatest interest lies in its demonstration of the manner in which a story brought to the North from the South Germanic lands could be adapted to the understanding and tastes of its <pb id="pb500" n="500" facs="f:534"/>eleventh century hearers without any material change of the basic narrative.
</p><p>In what form or forms the story of the Gjukungs and Atli reached the Greenland poet cannot be determined, but it seems likely that he was familiar with older poems on the subject, and possibly with the <hi>Atlakvitha</hi> itself. That the details which are peculiar to the <hi>Atlamol</hi>, such as the figures of Kostbera and Glaumvor, existed in earlier tradition seems doubtful, but the son of Hogni, who aids Guthrun in the slaying of Atli, appears, though under another name, in other late versions of the story, and it is impossible to say just how much the poet relied on his own imagination and how far he found suggestions and hints in the prose or verse stories of Atli with which he was familiar.
</p><p>The poem is in Malahattr (cf. Introduction) throughout, the verse being far more regular than in the <hi>Atlakvitha</hi>. The compilers of the <hi>Volsungasaga</hi> evidently knew it in very much the form in which we now have it, for in the main it is paraphrased with great fidelity.</p></div2><div2 type="Section"><lg id="lg2.19.1" type="Verse"><l><ab type="verseNum"><ref target="n2.19.1">1</ref>.</ab> There are many who know &#160;&#160;|&#160;&#160; how of old did men

Of the three early historical kings who gradually assumed a dominant place in Germanic legend, Ermanarich, king of the East Goths in the middle of the fourth century, was actually the least important, even though Jordanes, the sixth century author of <hi>De Rebus Getecis</hi>, compared him to Alexander the Great. Memories of his cruelty and of his tragic death, however, persisted along with the real glories of Theoderich, a century and a half later, and of the conquests of Attila, whose lifetime approximately bridged the gap between Ermanarich&#8217;s death and Theoderich&#8217;s birth.
</p><p>Chief among the popular tales of Ermanarich&#8217;s cruelty was one concerning the death of a certain Sunilda or Sanielh, whom, according to Jordanes, he caused to be torn asunder by wild horses because of her husband&#8217;s treachery. Her brothers, Sarus and Ammius, seeking to avenge her, wounded but failed to kill Ermanarich. In this story is the root of the two Norse poems included in the <hi lang="la" xml:lang="la">Codex Regius</hi>. Sunilda easily became the wife as well as the victim of the tyrant, and, by the process of legend-blending so frequently observed, the story was connected with the more famous one of the Nibelungs by making her the daughter of Sigurth and Guthrun. To account for her brothers, a third husband had to be found for Guthrun; the Sarus and Ammius of Jordanes are obviously the Sorli and Hamther, sons of Guthrun and Jonak, of the Norse poems. The blending of the Sigurth and Ermanarich legends probably, though not certainly, took place before the story reached the North, in other words before the end of the eighth century.
</p><p>Regarding the exact status of the <hi>Guthrunarhvot</hi> and the <hi>Hamthesmol</hi> there has been a great deal of discussion. That they are closely related is obvious; indeed the first parts of the two poems are nearly identical in content and occasionally so in actual diction. The annotator, in his concluding prose note, refers to <pb id="pb537" n="537" facs="f:571"/>the second poem as the &#8220;old&#8221; ballad of Hamther, wherefore it has been assumed by some critics that the composer of the <hi>Guthrunarhvot</hi> used the <hi>Hamthesmol</hi>, approximately as it now stands, as the source of part of his material. The extant <hi>Hamthesmol</hi>, however, is almost certainly a patchwork; part of it is in Fornyrthislag (cf. Introduction), including most of the stanzas paralleled in the <hi>Guthrunarhvot</hi>, and likewise the stanza followed directly by the reference to the &#8220;old&#8221; ballad, while the rest is in Malahattr. The most reasonable theory, therefore, is that there existed an old ballad of Hamther, all in Fornyrthislag, from which the composer of the <hi>Guthrunarhvot</hi> borrowed a few stanzas as the introduction for his poem, and which the composer of the extant, or &#8220;new,&#8221; <hi>Hamthesmol</hi> likewise used, though far more clumsily.
</p><p>The title &#8220;Guthrunarhvot,&#8221; which appears in the <hi lang="la" xml:lang="la">Codex Regius</hi>, really applies only to stanzas 1&#8211;8, all presumably borrowed from the &#8220;old&#8221; ballad of Hamther. The rest of the poem is simply another Guthrun lament, following the tradition exemplified by the first and second Guthrun lays; it is possible, indeed, that it is made up of fragments of two separate laments, one (stanzas 9&#8211;18) involving the story of Svanhild&#8217;s death, and the other (stanzas 19&#8211;21) coming from an otherwise lost version of the story in which Guthrun closely follows Sigurth and Brynhild in death. In any event the present title is really a misnomer; the poet, who presumably was an eleventh century Icelander, used the episode of Guthrun&#8217;s inciting her sons to vengeance for the slaying of Svanhild simply as an introduction to his main subject, the last lament of the unhappy queen.
</p><p>The text of the poem in <hi>Regius</hi> is by no means in good shape, and editorial emendations have been many and varied, particularly in interchanging lines between the <hi>Guthrunarhvot</hi> and the <hi>Hamthesmol</hi>. The <hi>Volsungasaga</hi> paraphrases the poem with such fidelity as to prove that it lay before the compilers of the saga approximately in its present form.</p></div2><div2 type="Section"><p id="prose2.20">Guthrun went forth to the sea after she had slain Atli.

There was brought up Svanhild, Sigurth&#8217;s daughter; she was married to the mighty Jormunrek. With him was Bikki, who counselled that Randver, the king&#8217;s son, should have her. This Bikki told to the king. The king had Randver hanged, and Svanhild trodden to death under horses&#8217; feet. And when Guthrun learned this, she spake with her sons.

The <hi>Volsungasaga</hi> follows this note in making Erp likewise a son of Guthrun, but in the <hi>Hamthesmol</hi> he is a son of Jonak by another wife. <hi>Svanhild</hi>: cf. <hi>Sigurtharkvitha en skamma</hi>, 54 and note. <hi>Jormunrek</hi> (Ermanarich): cf. introductory note. <hi>Bikki</hi>: the Sifka or Sibicho of the Gothic legends of Ermanarich, whose evil counsel always brings trouble. <hi>Randver</hi>: in the <hi>Volsungasaga</hi> Jormunrek sends his son Randver with Bikki to seek Svanhild&#8217;s hand. On the voyage home Bikki says to Randver: &#8220;It were right for you to have so fair a wife, and not such an old man.&#8221; Randver was much pleased with this advice, &#8220;and he spake to her with gladness, and she to him.&#8221; Thus the story becomes near of kin to those of Tristan and Iseult and Paolo and Francesca. According to the <hi>Volsungasaga</hi>, Bikki told Ermanarich that a guilty love existed between his son and his young wife, and presumably the annotator here meant as much by his vague &#8220;this.&#8221;

Most editors agree that there is a more or less extensive gap after stanza 18, and some of them contend that the original ending of the poem is lost, stanzas 19&#8211;21 coming from a different poem, probably a lament closely following Sigurth&#8217;s death.
</p><p id="n2.20.19"><ab type="parNum"><ref target="lg2.20.19">19</ref>.</ab> The manuscript does not indicate line 1 as beginning a stanza, and it immediately follows the fragmentary line 3 of stanza 18. The resemblance between stanzas 19&#8211;21 and stanzas 64&#8211;69 of <hi>Sigurtharkvitha en skamma</hi> suggests that, in some otherwise lost version of the story, Guthrun, like Brynhild, sought to die soon after Sigurth&#8217;s death. <hi>Thy steed</hi>: Guthrun&#8217;s appeal to the dead Sigurth to ride back to earth to meet her is reminiscent of the episode related in <hi>Helgakvitha Hundingsbana II</hi>, 39&#8211;48. The promise mentioned in stanza 20 is spoken of elsewhere only in the <hi>Volsungasaga</hi> paraphrase of this passage.

The origin of the story, the relation of the <hi>Hamthesmol</hi> to the <hi>Guthrunarhvot</hi>, and of both poems to the hypothetical &#8220;old&#8221; <hi>Hamthesmol</hi>, are outlined in the introductory note to the <hi>Guthrunarhvot</hi>. The <hi>Hamthesmol</hi> as we have it is certainly not the &#8220;old&#8221; poem of that name; indeed it is so pronounced a patchwork that it can hardly be regarded as a coherent poem at all. Some of the stanzas are in Fornyrthislag, some are in Malahattr, one (stanza 29) appears to be in Ljothahattr, and in many cases the words can be adapted to any known metrical form only by liberal emendation. That any one should have deliberately composed such a poem seems quite incredible, and it is far more likely that some eleventh century narrator constructed a poem about the death of Hamther and Sorli by piecing together various fragments, and possibly adding a number of Malahattr stanzas of his own.
</p><p>It has been argued, and with apparently sound logic, that our extant <hi>Hamthesmol</hi> originated in Greenland, along with the <hi>Atlamol</hi>. In any case, it can hardly have been put together before the latter part of the eleventh century, although the &#8220;old&#8221; <hi>Hamthesmol</hi> undoubtedly long antedates this period. Many editors have attempted to pick out the parts of the extant poem which were borrowed from this older lay, but the condition of the text is such that it is by no means clear even what stanzas are in Fornyrthislag and what in Malahattr. Many editors, likewise, indicate gaps and omissions, but it seems doubtful whether the extant <hi>Hamthesmol</hi> ever had a really consecutive quality, its component fragments having apparently been strung together with little regard for continuity. The notes indicate some of the more important editorial suggestions, but make no attempt to cover all of them, and the metrical form of the translation is often based on mere guesswork as to the character of the original lines and stanzas. Despite the chaotic state of the text, however, the underlying narrative is reasonably clear, and the story can be followed with no great difficulty.</p></div2><div2 type="Section"><pb id="pb546" n="546" facs="f:580"/><lg id="lg2.21.1" type="Verse"><l><ab type="verseNum"><ref target="n2.21.1">1</ref>.</ab> Great the evils &#160;&#160;|&#160;&#160; once that grew,

The Erp here referred to is not to be confused with the Erp, son of Jonak, who appears in stanza 13. The whole of stanza 8 is in doubtful shape, and many emendations have been suggested.

The <hi>Volsungasaga</hi>, however, indicates that Guthrun at this point &#8220;had so fashioned their war-gear that iron would not bite into it, and she bade them to have nought to do with stones or other heavy things, and told them that it would be ill for them if they did not do as she said.&#8221; The substance of this counsel may well have been conveyed in a passage lost after line 3, though the manuscript indicates no gap. It is by being stoned that Hamther and Sorli are killed (stanza 26). On the other hand, the second part of line 3 may possibly mean &#8220;if silent ye are not,&#8221; in which case the advice relates to Hamther&#8217;s speech to Jormunrek and Sorli&#8217;s reproach to him thereupon (stanzas 25 and 27). <hi>Steps</hi>: the word in the original is doubtful. Line 3 is thoroughly obscure. Some editors make a separate stanza of lines 3&#8211;5, while others question line 5.
</p><p id="n2.21.12"><ab type="parNum"><ref target="lg2.21.12">12</ref>.</ab> Many editors assume the loss of a line after line 1. In several editions lines 2&#8211;3 are placed after line 2 of stanza 18. <hi>Hunnish</hi>: the word meant little more than &#8220;German&#8221;; cf. <hi>Guthrunarhvot</hi>, 3 and note.

The manuscript indicates no gap. <hi>The man so wise</hi>: Erp, here represented as a son of Jonak but not of Guthrun, and hence a half-brother of Hamther and Sorli. There is nothing further to indicate whether or not he was born out of wedlock, as intimated in stanza 16. Some editors assign line 3 to Hamther, and some to Sorli.
</p><p id="n2.21.14"><ab type="parNum"><ref target="lg2.21.14">14</ref>.</ab> The stanza is obviously defective. Many editors add Erp&#8217;s name in line 1, and insert between lines 2 and 3 a line based on stanza 15 and the <hi>Volsungasaga</hi> paraphrase: &#8220;As a flesh-grown hand &#160;&#160;|&#160;&#160; another helps.&#8221; In the <hi>Volsungasaga</hi>, after Erp&#8217;s death, Hamther stumbles and saves himself from falling with his hand, whereupon he says: &#8220;Erp spake truly; I had fallen had I not braced myself with my hand.&#8221; Soon thereafter Sorli has a like experience, one foot slipping but the other saving him from a fall. &#8220;Then they said that they had done ill to Erp, their brother.&#8221;

</p><p id="n2.21.23"><ab type="parNum"><ref target="lg2.21.23">23</ref>.</ab> <hi>Gjuki&#8217;s heirs</hi>: the original has &#8220;the well-born of Gjuki,&#8221; and some editors have changed the proper name to Guthrun, but the phrase apparently refers to Hamther and Sorli as Gjuki&#8217;s grandsons. In the manuscript this stanza is followed by stanza 11, <pb id="pb553a" n="553" facs="f:587"/>and such editors as have retained this arrangement have had to resort to varied and complex explanations to account for it.
</p><p id="n2.21.24"><ab type="parNum"><ref target="lg2.21.24">24</ref>.</ab> Editors have made various efforts to reconstruct a four-line stanza out of these two lines, in some cases with the help of lines borrowed from the puzzling stanza 11 (cf. note on stanza 23). Line 2 in the original is doubtful.
</p><p id="n2.21.25"><ab type="parNum"><ref target="lg2.21.25">25</ref>.</ab> Some editors mark line 1 as an interpolation. The manuscript marks line 4 as beginning a new stanza.

</p><p id="n2.21.26"><ab type="parNum"><ref target="lg2.21.26">26</ref>.</ab> The manuscript marks line 3, and not line 1, as beginning a stanza. <hi>Of the race of the gods</hi>: the reference here is apparently to Jormunrek, but in the <hi>Volsungasaga</hi> the advice to kill Hamther and Sorli with stones, since iron will not wound them (cf. note on stanza 11), comes from Othin, who enters the hall as an old man with one eye.

Some editors, however, give lines 1&#8211;2 to Hamther and lines 3&#8211;4 to Sorli. <hi>Bag</hi>: i.e., Hamther&#8217;s mouth; cf. note on stanza 11. The manuscript indicates line 3 as beginning a new stanza.
</p><p id="n2.21.28"><ab type="parNum"><ref target="lg2.21.28">28</ref>.</ab> Most editors regard stanzas 28&#8211;30 as a speech by Hamther, but the manuscript does not indicate the speaker, and some editors assign one or two of the stanzas to Sorli. Lines 1&#8211;2 are quoted in the <hi>Volsungasaga</hi>. The manuscript does not indicate line 1 as beginning a stanza. <hi>Erp</hi>: Hamther means that while the two brothers had succeeded only in wounding Jormunrek, Erp, if he had been with them, would have killed him. Lines 3&#8211;4 may be a later interpolation. <hi>Norns</hi>: the fates; the word used in the original means the goddesses of ill fortune.

</p><p>The pronunciations indicated in the following index are in many cases, at best, mere approximations, and in some cases the pronunciation of the Old Norse is itself more or less conjectural. For the sake of clarity it has seemed advisable to keep the number of phonetic symbols as small as possible, even though the result is occasional failure to distinguish between closely related sounds. In every instance the object has been to provide the reader with a clearly comprehensible and approximately correct pronunciation, for which reason, particularly in such matters as division of syllables, etymology has frequently been disregarded for the sake of phonetic clearness. For example, when a root syllable ends in a long (double) consonant, the division has arbitrarily been made so as to indicate the sounding of both elements (e.g., Am-ma, not Amm-a).
</p><p>As many proper names occur in the notes but not in the text, and as frequently the more important incidents connected with the names are outlined in notes which would not be indicated by textual references alone, the page numbers include all appearances of proper names in the notes as well as in the text.
</p><p>The following general rules govern the application of the phonetic symbols used in the index, and also indicate the approximate pronunciation of the unmarked vowels and consonants.

</p><p><hi rend="sc">Accents.</hi> The accented syllable in each name is indicated by the acute accent (&#8242;). In many names, however, and particularly in compounds, there is both a primary and a secondary accent, and where this is the case the primary stress is indicated by a double acute accent (&#8243;) and the secondary one by a single acute accent (&#8242;). To avoid possible confusion with the long vowel marks used in Old Norse texts, the accents are placed, not over the vowels, but after the accented syllables.
